<p>Hi,</p><p>Effexor was great for me, it was the third AD to try after the first two didn't do anything whatsoever. I was on it for about a year and it worked wonders, I seemed to be depression free, so me and my psychiatrist thought it's time to be off of it, and tapered off slowly for a couple of weeks. Then after 4 months of being off of all psychiatric meds I had a relapse " new depressive episode" after a horrible thing happened to me back then, so I was put on Paxil " my psychaitrist thought I shouldn't be on a previously used AD because it might not be as effective as it was the first time" but she was WRONG. Paxil didn't work at all so she put me on Effexor again which worked just as good as it did the first time. But it pooped out after a little less than a year :( and now I'm trying other stuff.</p><p>Good luck</p>
