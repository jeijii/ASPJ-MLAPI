<p>(((((Littlestar)))))</p><p>Youve had it rough.  But, you are alive and you deserve to be here. </p><p>Think about yourself or look at a picture of you as a little one.  That helped me once.  I looked at that little sweet innocent face and said to myself - well if I dont care enough about myself to be good to me, at least be good to her.  She doesnt deserve any less.</p><p>Maybe putting a picture up will help.  You are a very sweet person and much too hard on yourself.  So think of Little one and know that is you.  Be good to her and you!!!</p><p>We love you!!!   <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:">   Gentle Sun</p>
