That was partly why I discontinued serotonergic meds and switched to Wellbutrin (bupropion), which doesn't affect serotonin, and actually tends to enhance the sexual response.</span></p><p><span style="color:#000080;">You might want to ask your doctor about trying Wellbutrin. Also, some people add it to their SSRI to offset the sexual side effects.</span></p>
