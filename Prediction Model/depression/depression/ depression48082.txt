<p>Knighter Welcome to DF.  Your climax problem is not unusual with cymbalta.  It might improve over time.  I've been on cymbalta for several years and it does get better but not right away.  Please talk to your doctor before taking any herbal treatments as they are not always compatible with drugs.  The last thing you want is to cause some sort of interaction. Depending on your age and sexual relationship I would recommend just letting it go for a few weeks or months to see if things improve.  You know the saying "time heals all wounds" may actually transfer to healing this side effect as well.  I have found it takes many months for the body to adjust to the sexual effects of cymbalta.  Good luck and I hope  your depression is improved.</p>
