<p>Hey everyone. Just wanted to share a piece of good news with the community.</p><p>I'm sure a lot of people know or have heard that there are many pills out there that can strengthen the mind and body to help out with depression. I can vouch for that. I've been taking Fish Oil pills, Magnesium, Natural B vitamins, and Niacin (Vitamin B3) pills for the last month and a half. It has significantly improved my mental health. Not permanently because I still have my moments where I have the blues about life, but they do help. I know many of you are probably skeptical about this, but I wouldn't knock it until you try it.  Fish oil pills, with their Omega-3 Fatty acids, do help improve brain function. I feel like I'm not so clouded in my mind anymore and I'm not constantly thinking negative thoughts. The B vitamins do provide substantial energy, as well as improve brain and nerve function. I'm not feeling as fatigued as I use to and I actually have the energy to exercise daily now. The Magnesium pills improve nerve and muscle function. I'm definitely not as sore as I use to be when I wake up every morning. I actually have motivation to do certain things now. Of course, this isn't a cure for depression, but every little thing helps. Motivation and strength are the main things these have been giving me. I felt crappy everyday for a year straight, but once I decided to start taking these vitamins daily, within about 2 weeks, I was noticing significantly positive effects. This was before I made any recent lifestyle changes, so there's obviously nothing else that could have caused these changes that I can think of.</p><p>I strongly encourage everyone to try these, if they haven't/aren't already.</p><p>Sidenotes: I took the maximum dosage daily with every pill. That's 4 1200mg fish oil pills/day, 2 250mg Magnesium pills, 2 Vitamin B pills (which contain B1, B2, B3, B6, folate, B12, Biotin, and pantothenic acid), and finally, 1 Niacin 500mg pill. I'm not suggesting you follow my method, but so far it has worked for me. Also, I've been exercising daily. Nothing like giving yourself a confidence boost. Take 30 minutes of your day and do as many sit ups and pushups as you can. Maybe go on a walk or a run. Get in 15-30 minutes of cardio. It will help in the long run as well as give you motivation in the short run.</p><p>Good luck everyone! Again, I strongly encourage these vitamins. It does get costly, but your health is priceless.</p><p>-Ray</p>
