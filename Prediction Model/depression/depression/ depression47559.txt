The article speculated that withdrawal symptoms can sometimes be delayed by several months, and can be pretty severe when they eventually do kick in. </p><p>The reason I am asking is, I identify with a lot of the side effects the author mentions (mainly about having a great big breakdown and losing your mind), but most other literature on the subject of SSRI withdrawal says that the symptoms are pretty immediate and pretty short-lived due to the the short half life most antidepressants have. </p><p>Has anyone got any experience of this, or any thoughts about it? I would be really interested to hear!</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Emma, just thought I would help with the comment that delayed side effects are pretty scarce to rare (from what I hear) usually they are right after stopping the medication and vanish over time, but some people have said they think they experienced a side-effect like 6 months down the road but it was kinda mild and over quickly.</p><p>Thought this might be helpful... others more experienced might have better advice than I...</p>
