<p>Here's my story.</p><p>I started having panic attacks when I was 20 years old, I'm currently 27 years old.  In desperation I went to the doctor who put me on ativan for a couple months and then Paxil.  Paxil was horrible, so I got off of it and tried Lexapro.  Lexapro has been good to me for the passed 7 years or so.  I started up at like 20mgs gradually went down to 10mgs and then went years on 5mgs with no anxiety or panic issues.  I felt great.</p><p>I've always has a lot of major issues with anxiety, obsessive thinking, paranoia, and as a result of all this depression.</p><p>Well recently I had some stressful times, lost my job, moved in with the folks and had a series of panic attacks.  So I went to my GPdoc who told me to go up on Lexapro to 10mgs and also prescribed me some seroquel (I had taken seroquel for a couple years as a sleep/anxiety aid worked well)  </p><p>Well I'm not sure what's going on with my chemisty, but I haven't been feeling good at all.  I seem to be getting more side effects than ever from the Lexapro.  Whenever I take it, an hour later I feel a bit anxious, agitated and restless.  At times I'm feeling overly excited and irritable.  I can't tell what's going on, whether I'm depressed or what.  I only seem to find myself for brief moments of the day and then I'm feeling really off.  My appetite has been gone for 2 months now, and I think it's the Lexapro kicking in again and messing with my system.  The seroquel seems to bring me temporary relief.  But every day I'm obsessing about my state of mind and how I feel.  It's been horrible.</p><p>Anyways, I'm not really sure what to do anymore.  I think 10mgs of Lexapro is too much for me as the sedation and drone effect sometimes makes me depressed and I want to try going down to 7.5mgs or up on seroquel, but I'm almost scared of going down or even up and feeling depressed or relapsing, but the side effects seem to be persisting.  Do you think I should just stick it out on the drug and maybe after a few more weeks I'll be stable?  Or would increasing the dosage maybe bring me benefits?  I have a hard time rating my progress as I'm going up and down a lot.  I'm somewhat concerned the drug has stopped working well for me as I feel more and more depressed.  On a side note, my anxiety and panic has pretty much been cured.</p><p>Weird thing is the more my anxiety goes away, the closer to depression I am.  It's quite the nightmare.  I feel like maybe the Lexapro is working well on anxiety, but I'm becoming depressed.</p><p>I hate taking drugs, but I've accepted it's something I'm probably going to have to do until I'm at a better station in life.  I won't do anything without talking to my doctor first who I see in several weeks, just curious if anyone has gone through problems like this even remotely similar.  A peer voice is helpful to me.</p>
