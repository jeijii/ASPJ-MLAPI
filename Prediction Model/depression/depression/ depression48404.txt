<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I have BDD. I look at myself and I am instantly revolted - I see a fat, ugly female with m\nothing good about her outside, physical appearance. I fantasise about self harming myself to remove all the excess fat that makes my skin crawl - this way I'd be stitched up and in hospital for awhile so would maybe lose weight.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I have self starved, I binge for comfort, I have been obsessed with exercise, I have not exercised at all, I have controlled my diet sensibly, I have eaten whatever I want - I have never lost enough weight to be happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I hate myself to the point where I am in tears and yet can't seem to change anything about myself or learn to look at myself in a positive light. My doctors/therapists have never even touched on this as they have wanted to "cure" my depression more than my low self esteem and self loathing. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I'm attracted to women as well as men, and I like my women curvy. But when it comes to myself, I equate thinness with beauty and happiness. I look at myself and see an ugly whale.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">So I am begging you - can anyone please tell me how I can overcome this so I can be happy?</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Please</span></p>
