<p>Ok so I have finally accepted the fact that I am depressed and that I may possibly be bipolar II...the next question is..how does one go about seeking the proper help? To be honest I am so so scared to go see someone..a psychiatrist or therapist..I guess a pychiatrist would be the first place to go? So i can get the proper meds..BUT here is the thing..I am scared of going on meds..everyone of them have nasty side effects! Theres really not one i can think of or that I heard of from reading through the forums here that don't have nasty side effects. Weight gain is something I don't want at all (not that anyone else does either). I'm also afraid of KNOWING what is wrong with me or hearing what is wrong with me. Ive known for many many years that there was but again I was too scared to seek help for fear of knowing that I have a mental disorder. I wouldn't even know where to begin..or even once there what to say or do or what questions to ask. I'm afraid of someone prying into my mind picking apart my brain. But on the other hand I know I need help. I just can't go on like this any longer. I'm tired of the mood swings and the feeling down part..so so down. I hide it well though. Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Thank you</p>
