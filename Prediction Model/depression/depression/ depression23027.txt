<p>Hello allalone6,</p><p>I know meds effect us differently but I am suprise that Wellbutrin may be causing your weight gain.  I do agree with Katt55 and have read studies showing that Wellbutrin causes weight loss, but again, meds effect us differently.  I've been on Wellbutrin for a long time and it does curb my appetite which I don't mind but have to be careful because I have eating disorder issues.  My psychiatrist used Wellbutrin to help him stop smoking and lose weight because of his heart condition which he was successful in reaching his goals.</p><p>Check with your doctor and let him know what is happening especially if the weight gain continues.  But try to give the Wellbutrin more time to kick in so to speak.  It takes ADs 6 to 8 weeks to reach full therapuetic effect though you should feel some improvement in mood sooner in my opinion.</p><p>Lindahurt</p>
