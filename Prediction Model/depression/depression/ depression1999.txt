	I did a lot of research on this at one time. It doesn't mean I have taken my own advice. Once I felt I had to go to a psychiatrist-- that it was my only option-- then I did. 5 minutes in the chair, and the prescription pad came out. It was all about pushing drugs. I really do believe that what you eat and drink has a huge impact on your health-- mental and physical. But I also know that it takes a long time for those changes to get into your cellular structure.
