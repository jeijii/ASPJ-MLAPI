But its not just that, its silly things as well like mentioned in my previous thread.</p><p>Sometimes I get like a funny feeling go over me, almost  like a breeze, and then I just get short tempered and everything grates and irritates. It worries me because I know how nutty I look when I get angry. And I wonder why I get so worked up, the logical part of my brain is trying to calm me down but the conscious part is like a child that doesn't want to listen. </p><p>I was out walking the other day and a kid dropped a wrapper on the floor, purposefully, and part of me was already screaming in my head "pick that up you little ****!" Whilst the other part of me was just saying "go and pick it up, stop making a fuss he's just a kid" </p><p>I do go out running and go to the gym to try and destress and yes I do feel better when I have gone. But it never lasts long. Maybe I just need a holiday. I read and write as well. </p><p>I have been on the venlafaxine for around 3 months now, and admit I do feel alot better than previous so its obviously working. </p><p>I have just split with my bf which probably doesn't help, I feel alot of anger towards him. And I guess I have no way to vent that. Trashing his car is out of the option.</p>
