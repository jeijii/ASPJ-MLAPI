<p>Well, I had my first ect this morning. Right side unilateral for 37 seconds. The side effects have been minimal - I bit the inside of my lip a little, slight headache for a few hours and TM joint pain on one side for a few hours.  I didn't sleep last night at all, so when we got home I slept for a little over 8 hours. Positive? I obviously didn't forget my username and password, in fact no memory loss as far as I can tell. My head seems a little clearer, less foggy or something. Not a huge difference, but noticeable. I'm not beating myself up for sleeping the day away, which is what I usually do. My wife noted that I cracked a few funnies, which I haven't been doing much of lately.</p><p>My psych feels that if you get even a slight improvement after the first round, that's a positive sign for the treatment outcome as a whole. So - I'm extremely hopeful for the first time in ages that things can change. I hope Ladysmurf is feeling the same.</p>
