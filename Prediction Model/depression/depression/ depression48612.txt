<p>Reading this, alot of people talk about being overly emotional / sensitive, most with traumatic life events. I don't know if it was genetic - I was adopted and haven't contacted my birth mother.</p><p>I come from the other side of the fence. My parents are great people, but I think I learnt alot of my dad's reserved nature - and then some. I've had no huge issues in my life. No abuse, drug problems etc. I've dated girls but never really been that involved. Theres no one bad event that I can tie when I started feeling how I do to... I cant even pinpoint the year.</p><p>I feel so emotionally detached from everyone that I honestly am not sure I could cry if one of my close family died. I don't know what love feels like anymore. Affection, true sadness, unbridled joy - they are nothing but words to me. I live inside this shell that I must have created at some point, and it protects me from everything and everyone except my own mind.</p><p>I laugh at things, but even things I find funny, I'm not sure I really enjoy.</p><p>Each day I act out my life, smiling and greeting people. </p><p>I think my depression has come about from that. I am alone emotionally... despite knowing I have people that care for me, I just don't feel this bond. And loneliness brings all its demons with it.</p><p>The times I've thought of harming myself have always been fairly cold and rational, albeit coloured by a major tendency towards negative thinking. I feel 'down', but not really sad, as such. Despondent would be closer.</p><p>I'm not quite sure I've explained this well. And I'm still making the assumption that my doc got it right when he said he thought I had depression - I told him this.</p>
