<p>I am now 21 years old.  I have fallen into a deep depression again, started about 3 months ago.  I have had major ups and downs since I was young, like 15 or even younger.  I believe I prolonged my high periods through using stimulants (such as coffee, nicotine, coping with alcohol on a weekly basis) and adrenaline rushes to keep me going.  I had a major mental breakdown, where I'm at now, not using alcohol, trying to pick up the pieces.  I'm trying to move forward, I am tired of this, I have a support network, I'm seeing a counselor, and in a couple of days I have an appointment with an actual psychiatrist for the first time.</p><p>My first question question pertains to my use of anti-depressants, I was prescribed Prozac, I must have been about 15.  I couldn't have taken it longer than maybe 3 months, don't remember if it helped or not, those years are pretty blurry to me, but for years after I had brain shivers spuratically after not taking the meds.  I really hated this.  When I had my latest breakdown about 3 months ago, at wits end so I went to a doctor who prescribed me Zoloft.  I took ONE 50 mg pill and the brain shivers (I hope you know what I'm talking about and what they feel like in your head like a buzzing) everyday for a week!  I didn't want to take anymore after the first pill, so I didn't.  I can't stand the feeling.  I also can't stand being depressed...</p><p>I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience? </p><p>Also wondering if 5-HTP has been helpful with anyone?  I'm wondering about the safety of it, if it's okay to take, or if it's going to deplete my seretonin more?  I don't know.  So anyone help... please?</p>
