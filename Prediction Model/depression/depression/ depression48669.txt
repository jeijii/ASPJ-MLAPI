I have tried various SSRI meds, Aropax, Lovan, Lexapro and now Zoloft, every single one has had some pretty severe side effects from increasing the depression, or increasing the anxiety to severe nausea and just recently, hot flushes to the point where I felt like my face was on fire. </span><p><span style="font-size:12px;">I have been diagnosed as bipolar, but recently was put on a mood stabiliser, I was told that this time, trying an SSRi would be different as I was on a mood stabiliser. I am really petrified, because my pdoc has now started to think that my body can't tolerate anti-depressants. </span></p><p><span style="font-size:12px;">I have noticed though every single one I have tried is an SSRI, I guess it got me thinking could it just be that I have bad reactions to SSRIs or something worse, if I can't tolerate them, does this mean that the depression side of things will be so much harder to treat or does it mean that the only way to treat the depression will be through more agressive measures? Does it mean that my depression won't respond to meds.... I am just really confused right now. It is something I will be bringing up in my next appointment with my pdoc of course...</span></p><p><span style="font-size:12px;">I'm just wondering if anybody else has had a similar experience? Is there hope? </span></p></div></blockquote><p>They do sound quite extreme side effect Wild Rose. How long were you on each one for as depression and anxiety often gets worse until you get used to them?</p>
