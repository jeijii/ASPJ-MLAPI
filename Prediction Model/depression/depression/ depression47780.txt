It does take trial and error to get that one medication that is going to be effective for you.</p><p>I found Paxil, Prozac and Citalopram  effective for me. I am now on 40mg of Paxil because Citalopram was starting to 'poop' out for me. </p><p>It is really is a case of try the different SSRI meds until you find the one that make you feel very well and you will really feel the difference. As far as improving the sexual side that is tricky and take time ans patience. </p><p>Best Wishes</p><p>Jim Bow</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Hey, guys, </p><p>I just want to say that contrary to jimbow's experience, I have been tried on different SSRIs and found that none of them were effective for me. From that, I can only conclude that that class of medication does not work for me. Therefore, my doc has tried different classes of medication for me. What has worked for me in the past were the tri-cyclics (Tofranil, Amytryptaline, etc), and Cymbalta, which is an SNRI (selective <strong>norepinephrine</strong> re-uptake inhibitor). This is the reason why it is important to have a doctor who is well versed in the different classes of medication. Try to be optimistic; when you find the right medication, it will be well worth the wait.</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>will my doctor know to put me on the tri-cyclics? or will they keep trying different SSRIs</p>
