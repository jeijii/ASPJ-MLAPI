I had the same problem with temazepam before and had to stop taking it for a long while before it would work again.</p><p>I'm in a similar situation as you are.  I need to fix my sleep before I start working again.  I normally can't sleep until 5 or 7 am and I'll sleep till 1 pm.  Sometimes I try to stay up all day stright by finding something to do so I can be tired in the evening and be able to fall asleep.</p>
