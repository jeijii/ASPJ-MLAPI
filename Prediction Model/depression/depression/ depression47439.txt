I've also tried a million things for depression and after several of the "typical" drugs (Prozac, Celexa, Cymbalta, Effexor... the last made me freak out completely, awful), he decided to try lamictal. If your moods/irritability are the biggest problem, it could definitely help! That's actually the only thing it seems to help me with, so I have the opposite problem... it takes the edge off, and I've found if I even miss one dose, I can turn into a moody, angry, irritable mess. No side effects at all that I remember... but it just doesn't help my depression. <p>Just curious, but did going on Wellbutrin or Adderall increase your anxiety? I thought Wellbutrin (I've taken it years ago but I honestly don't remember how much it helped) was more "activating." And I've certainly had issues with too-high doses of Adderall that gave me crazy anxiety... I used to take 30mg XR and it was fine, but for some reason after I had a baby and tried to go back onto it, I had to cut my dose in half 'cause of awful anxiety. But no interactions between the two that I've ever noticed!</p></div></blockquote><p>Strangely enough, it didn't affect my anxiety. I thought it would.</p>
