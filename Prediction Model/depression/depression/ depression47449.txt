Always had to go back to my old stand-by medications 'cause they just didn't do it for me. There is one that there has been a buzz about called 'N-AcetylCysteine". It has been reported to be helpful in cases of depression and obsessive compulvise disorder. I bought some and found it to be rather stimulating and too powerful for me. Maybe you would like it. Another one that is supposed to be good is DL-Phenylalanine, in cases of depression. Right now I'm taking magnesium glycinate which is the mineral magnesium bound to the amino-acid glycine. It seems to be helping me in a low dose combined with doxepin hci, an antidepressant. Don't mix amino-acids with any medications you might be on without doctors approval--could cause complications!</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Thank you BOTH for your replies / comments!</p><p>Actually, for the past month, I've pretty much been sticking to taking L-Tyrosine specifically....along with alot of B-Complex and C. I did mention this to my pdoc last month and he wasn't aware of L-Tyrosine specifically...he knew much more about the potential SE of taking high doses of Tryptophan along with SSRI's(I'm taking Lexapro). However, he cautioned me to STOP taking the L-Tyrosine anyway just in case. For now, I have NOT done that. I am still sticking to my current regimen. At least in my reading/research so far, I have not found any correlation to possible complications combining L-Tyrosine with SSRI's since they hypothetically affect different neurotransmitters. Do you think this is "dangerous"?</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>hi daddy, if your dr. told you not to take a particular substance, then you should follow his advice. I have read on the internet that supplemts of l-tyrosine have absolutely no effect on mood and large doses may actually lower your brains level of dopamine. Years ago I tried combining l-tyrosine with my antidepressant doxepin. I had a really good rise in my mood but it only lasted about two weeks then gradually went back to normal. The problem I believe is that there is a "rate limiting enzyme" in the brain that checks the level of l-tyrosine and norepinephrine  and throws it back down to the level that is funcitional for mood. I have also read that l-tyrosine can raise blood pressure. Antidepressants weren't specifically designed to be taken alongside amino acid oral supplements. If you were taking a antidepressant that already had some blood pressure raising effects and took l-tyrosine, it could raise it futher and who knows....maybe lead to a stroke or? You wouldn't want to be driving down the street and have a stroke...you could crash your car and/ or run into somebody else. Also it is dangerous to take l-tyrosine if you have melanoma skin cancer as the tumors will feed on it. So better to be on the safe side and follow the good doctors advice ! <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_shocked.gif" alt=":shocked:"></p>
