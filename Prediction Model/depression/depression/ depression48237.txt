I am pretty new to this website, so I am still getting used to how to use it. </p><p>I have been going through an Anhedonic purgatory for the last few years.  I was on an SSRI called Lexapro (Escitalopram) for around 4 years.  I decided to come off of it because of weight gain and other side effects.  Ever since coming off of this drug, I have felt numb and disconnected from everything involved with living life.  No interests in things, No pleasure, No laughter, No crying, just a state of fog and dissociation. </p><p>In the past few years I have managed my issues with exercise, strict diet, good sleep routine, and alternative vitamins and supplements.  I am at a point now where I feel like I need to give prescription medication another shot.  I have come as far as I can with natural methods, and as scared as I am of medications, I am going to try them again.  I have felt in my heart that the SSRI, in some way, caused this blunted personality I deal with.  I am trying to except that it may only be the Depression causing it all. </p><p>In any matter, I have an appointment with my Psychiatrist in a few days, and I believe my choices are Vortioxetine, Cymbalta, or Zoloft.  But hey, He could prescribe pretty much anything at this point, so I really have no idea.  My head is kind of exhausted from reading about all the different medications I could potentially try. </p><p>I am really happy that you are making some progress, slight as it may be, and I hope it continues to improve.  Anhedonia is an awful state to be stuck in, I really appreciate the understanding and caring people on this site, It makes me feel less alone in the struggle.</p><p>All the best, Take care,</p><p>Mike</p></div></div></blockquote><p> Mike, it's no problem at all. Welcome to the site! While I don't think it caused my anhedonia, I was on Lexapro before and noticed it did nothing to help my anhedonia. It also took away my creativity, which greatly upset me. I know some people get "it" (anhedonia) while taking SSRIs, or even after going off, and with Lexapro acting the way it did for me - it really wouldn't surprise me if it caused someone anhedonia. It's hard to tell what the meds cause sometimes, vs the depression itself. The side effects of Lexapro were not fun for me either, especially for a medication my doctor praised as having so few side effects! Few side effects my a**!</p><p> I hope that your appointment goes well and you are able to find some form of relief. Let us know how the appointment goes. Thank you for your kind words, and feel free to private message me any time you'd like.</p><p>- Christina</p>
