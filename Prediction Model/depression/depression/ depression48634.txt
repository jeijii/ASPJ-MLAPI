Dopamine action may actually be why you got mild psychosis from what I understand of these things.</p><p>You may find one of the SSRIs works for you as they all work very slightly differently behind the scenes, although if Celexa didn't help depression at all I wouldn't necessarily bet on Lexapro working since Lexapro is the more selective, cleaner version. Might get less side-effects so you can try it for longer though!</p><p>Personally I'd try Cymbalta next as you haven't listed SNRIs.</p><p>Again, none of this constitutes actual medical advice, just my own research into things because of my ridiculously odd reactions to meds :p</p>
