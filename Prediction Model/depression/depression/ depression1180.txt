Please don't be afraid to keep sharing. I'm not sure if it means anything to you, but I DO believe what you have shared so far. Even if you were telling lies... I wouldn't be upset anyhow. I think people are essentially good on the inside and if they lie about things there is usually a reason. I try to look past people's "sins" and understand why they do what they do. I am far from perfect and I don't expect anybody else to be.</p><p>You have had such a tough life but your past has a grip on you which is controlling how you are today. You can move on... I believe you can. I was picked on and rejected all through school too.</p><p>My heart really goes out to you lynndyloo as I know your life CAN change.</p><p>While you hold onto the past you can not move forward. It's like walking and continually looking behind you... if you do that you are going to run into polls, walk in front of cars, trip over but most importantly miss out on life because life happens in front of you and not behind.</p><p>You under estimate yourself lynndyloo, you under estimate your ability to change and to move forward. I don't under estimate you.</p>
