	So, my GP had me on 30 mg buspar (10 mg three times a day), along with 40 mg Prozac once a day, and .5 mg ativan as needed.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Psychiatrist said buspar wouldn't help me and took me off it (I've been on it 16 days), and changed Ativan to Klonopin because it has a longer half-life. 
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	I'm on day 32 of Prozac, but only day 15 of 40 mg of Prozac. Was on 20 mg the first two weeks.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	My anxiety/panic attacks are still paralyzing and I can't go to work or spend time outside of my bedroom.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	I am worried if I stop the buspar and my anxiety/panic attacks get worse that i'll have to start all over with building it up in my system. The logical part of my brain says to do what the psychiatrist says, but the worried part is telling me not to.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Opinions?
