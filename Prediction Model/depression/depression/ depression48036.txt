I also have atypical depression. I just started Abilify yesterday added to my AD's of Remeron and Wellbutrin. I don't have insurance either, but for the moment I'm surviving on samples of Abilify and the free trial until I can get some prescription assistance from the company. There is help out there.<p>As has been mentioned, MAOI's are useful for atypical depression. Unfortunately, I can't take them because I take another med that doesn't play nice with them.</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Hi lukn4hope,</p><p>I am still taking 10 mg Prozac daily and I have 1 mg Lorazepam for backup when my anxiety gets really bad. I'm doing okay, but I wouldn't say I feel "great." I'm not sure I would know what "normal" feels like anymore, as I've had this chronic low-level depression since childhood. My situation in life has gotten a bit better since my first post (I got a job in my field, I'm making decent money, just got benefits, etc.) so that has relieved some stress, but I don't think my depression was ever 'situational.' Certain life events have sent me into episodes of Double Depression, but this chronic Atypical form just hangs on no matter what, it seems. I'm reluctant to try more drugs. I'm not sure what else can be done, I feel like it's just something I'm going to have to live with. :(</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">Awww, I'm sorry the medicine isn't going so well for you.  :sad:  I think you've been on it long enough now for it to kick in or to have seen some significant improvement, so it might be time to find another antidepressant, maybe to try increasing the dose (30 mg was my lucky dose), or to add another medicine to your cocktail.  What does your doctor think about your progress?  </span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">You shouldn't feel like this is the best you can hope for.  Sometimes it can just take a while to find what works best for an individual.  Please don't give up.  There are tons of other options out there.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">Is your insurance situation any better?  Would it cover Effexor's generic form, Venlafaxine?  Generics are usually cheaper, though I don't know much about Effexor's generic form.   Are there any other SNRIs that your insurance will cover?  (I'm asking since you said in your first post that you responded somewhat to Effexor, which is an SNRI.  Maybe that class works better for you than the SSRIs. )</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">Best wishes.  </span></span><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hugs.gif" alt=":hugs:"></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">I do have an blog entry about atypical depression and general treatment options if you feel like reading it:  </span></span><a href="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/blog/1233/entry-18612-atypical-depression-aka-depression-with-atypical-features"><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">http://www.depressio...ypical-features</span></span></a></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">See, there are still plenty of options for you to try.  </span></span><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.gif" alt=":smile:"></p>
