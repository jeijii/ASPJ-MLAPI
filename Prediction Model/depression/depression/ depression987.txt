<p>Thanks everyone for understanding.  I was a little leary of posting this in fear of resentment.  I don't know if I'll go or not.  I likely will for my mom and especially my grandmother.  She has already lost one son (I liked him) due to a drug overdose.  She looks through rose colored glasses when she looks at him.  I won't say anything negative to her though.  The last thing I would ever do is hurt my grandmother.  </p><p>I don't know when he's supposed to go.  Mom said within the next year.  He has Merca in his spine and has Hepatitis C.  I guess its so bad that he is pretty much paralyzed from the neck down.  He lies in that bed in his own hell now.  I wonder if he regrets what he did to my little cousin and lord knows what other children he molested.</p><p>I often wonder if a person is a product of their environment.  So many of my family members (on mom's side) are drug addicts and have been in and out of prison.  One for accomplise to m*****.  They all grew up in a very poor home with alcoholic parents.  They were all placed in foster care and/or orphanges off and on throughout their childhood.  My mom made it out fine, as did my aunt and one uncle.  The other four I won't discuss.  My doctors often ask if their is mental illness in my family.  How is one to tell when more than half of them are so screwed up you don't even want to go to their funeral.</p><p>Sorry, getting off the subject.</p><p>Lost in the Past</p>
