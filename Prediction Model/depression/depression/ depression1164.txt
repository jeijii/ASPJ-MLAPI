<p>Hi folks, i thought i'd fill you in on my progression on the EPA fish oils. </p><p>Its been a month now, and the effects are becoming clearer -  i am definitely feeling a lot "lighter" and clearer in mind, i am getting less stressed about things. I generally feel more lifted, and can laugh at things that i normally wouldnt of. Im still having ups and downs, but the downs are getting shorter. There has been a definite improvement, i still have a way to go, and time will tell. </p><p> The capsules i take are not too large, but i do notice that i have to take them with plenty of water to wash them down -if not, they tend to give off a bit of an unpleasant taste in the mouth. I have also had an occassional stomach upset with them, but its only mild, and is reducing with time.</p><p>Overall, the result so far is very good, but i will be able to tell even more as time goes by. </p><p>                           Take Care! xxx <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p>
