<p>Hi,</p><p>Meds are often what you and I might describe as "experimental" mate.</p><p>I live in Australia and our government's approach (Yes I actually agree with one thing they do) is to wait about a year after new drugs are released in other countries. Fact.</p><p>Not all drugs of course. But mostly. Which means we, Australians, are not the front line for testing which is what the early users are.</p><p>Yes they do trials, research and so on but it is rare indeed that long term effects are, or will be known.</p><p>That apart essentially our choice when way down in the pits is simple.</p><p>Do we want to feel that pain or try treatment. If we do we can choose meds or talk therapy mainly. 2 choices. Yes there are many alternative options and my attitude on that is "if it works for you then do it". </p><p>But it is meds that do give relief mainly rather than any other treatment. Long term it's probably not the answer but what is?</p><p>My approach to side effects is this. If it seems a bigger problem than the depression then stop that med and try another.</p><p>Check the risks. Google. Would you feel better not taking prescribed meds?</p><p>My shrink says the chemicals generally wash out of our systems within 24 hours When I first saw him he also thought that the side effects went too. Wrong.</p><p>I pointed out that weight gain did not drop off as soon as the drugs were out of the body. He saw the point. </p><p>Not that I'm any expert, on anything, he just had no real concept of side effects and how bad they can be. I have a long term physical problem from one med and it's not going to get better.</p><p>Meds saved my life but I do wonder why I bother sometimes. Meds don't make you happy, never did, never will. All they do is relieve some symptoms which allows us some time and space to make changes so the depresion can improve. I fail that test every time.</p><p>To the person talking about Lamictal addiction. Sorry Google doesn't show anything on this. As someone else has asked you, how did this addiction present in you please? I take it and would like to know as much as I can. Let's know, yes?</p>
