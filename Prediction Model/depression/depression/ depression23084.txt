<p>I didn't have anything other than the horrible stomach thing with cymbalta.  It lasted a week and I went up to 60mg. with no side effects.  NO increase in anxiety.  None.  I had been on Lexapro for 15mo. prior to starting the Cymbalta and I remember that it took 7 mo. for the lexapro to reduce the anxiety to the point of where I didn't have to use ativan any longer.</p><p>I had the itching with Lexapro, but nothing that I couldn't handle.  I also had to stay out of the sun with Lexapro or I'd get a rash that really itched for a couple of days.  Are you going to try the 20mg. of Lexapro before you decide what you're going to do?  Maybe taking it at 6pm would help you relax better a couple of hours before you went to bed, too.  I remember doing this with Paxil and it made a big difference.</p><p>Let me know how you're getting along.  I'm always willing to help.  Getting on meds is on fo the most difficult things, isn't it?  You want to feel better, but it doesn't happen over night.  Sometimes, it take a good year to get on a combo that works!!!  It's very worth it vs. having symptoms all over the place.  I know I feel 100 times beter than what I did before meds!!!</p><p>Love,  Jackie    <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p>
