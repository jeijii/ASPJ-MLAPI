All throughout my school years I always struggled. I never paid attention, nothing interested me and of course I would daydream constantly. Never knew what I wanted to do in life but decided to go to college and get a business diploma which again just barely recieved because I couldn't really pay much attention in class. Got out of college and took a sales job and hated every minute of it. (never thought I was that good at it) moved on to another sales job and hated it as well. Left that after 10 months and took a travelling sales rep job, and until recently was there for 8 years. I worked for a man who was someone who likes to bully, intimidate and threaten to try to motivate. Now I am again a travelling sales rep for a smaller company and hate it. </p><p>The reason I am here on this board is because I am completely lost. I don't know what to do. I am stressed, unmotivated and depressed.  I have been taking effexor for 7 years (75mg) I have anxiety all the time to a point where I can't sleep at night. When I am at work or in social situations I can't pay attention to anyone when they are talking to me because I am constantly in my own little world always thinking of something else so I am never really that successful with anything because I can't pay attention. Thought I wanted to become a police officer, passed all the tests but failed all the interviews.  </p><p>I think I've pretty much tried everything, I work out 4 days a week, I eat really well and have some drinks maybe once every three months. It's gotten to a point where my wife just booked a doctors appointment for me because she can't handle my depression and mood swings. </p><p>My questions are; Can anyone relate to some of these things? Does it sound like Depression/Anxiety with ADHD? </p><p>I think the only thing that's keeping my head above water is my amazing wife and child........</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>For what it's worth, I think you should get evaluated for ADHD. The things you describe sound like that to me, but that's just what I'm reading here. </p><p>In general, it's definitely not uncommon for people like us to have trouble finding our place in the world, a job that fits us, etc. I'm a daydreamer, racing thoughts, moved from job to job, not finding my niche, etc. </p><p>It's really great you have a strong family life. I think seeing a psychiatrist will help. It sounds like overall you are very healthy, you just need some help with what's going on inside. Best wishes!</p>
