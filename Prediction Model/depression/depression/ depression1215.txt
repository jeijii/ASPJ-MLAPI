<p>I tried with Wellburtrin about 10 years ago and all I did was cry non stop.</p><p>2 years ago this past March, I started Chantix while still smoking, making my quit day about 10 days away.  </p><p>I noticed even before my quit date that I was slowly smoking less, my guess is the desire to smoke was decreasing.</p><p>My quit day arrived and have not smoked one since.  I did have to suffer through about 1.5 million nightmares though.  Every bad situation in my life, every fear I've ever had, every death I've ever witnessed and all the suffering and coping that goes along with it (I work in the medical field), I relived over and over again in my dreams.  I would also wake up every morning around 5 am, no matter what time I went to bed.  I also dreamed horrific dreams that my husband and kids had died.  All dreams were in extremely colorful and detailed in every way imaginable.  Many times, I awoke sitting in bed trying to catch my breath, broke out in a sweat.</p><p>But, after a month, I got to where I could train myself that when I woke up, I knew it was a dream and no freak out required.  I got to where I could go back to sleep, relieved that it was just a dream, and it really got bearable to deal with.  I renewed my script after 3 months because it turned out to be my crutch and I was able to deal with all the "stuff" okay.  By the end of another 3 months, I had already quit taking it and still smoke free.</p><p>I was only sick once and that was when I took it on an empty stomach.</p><p>So, while it is not for all, it certainly is what did the trick for me.</p>
