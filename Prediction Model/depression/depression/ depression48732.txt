<p><span style="color:#800080;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;"><em>I have asked my pharmacist and searched the internet for information concerning a new drug prescribed me by my PCP, but there seems to be nothing related to that which I am experiencing.  My psychiatrist (as well as my PCP) will not be available until Monday.  That leaves all weekend for questions (and side-effects).  I tend to react in the opposite fashion to that which is expected, to many medications, as compared to other patients.  I have taken two doses of the common muscle relaxant, "Soma", in the past 24-hour period.  Both times, I have not felt the typical sedating qualities which are mentioned, repeatedly, in patient reviews found on many websites.  As I'm bipolar, and I already get sent into orbit by anti-depressants, could it be remotely possible for this med to be having the same effect?  I'm not euphoric, just talkative, have especially racing thoughts (but extremely alert and sharp), can't sleep, and do tend to enjoy conversing with people more than I usually do.  I was told twice, once by the local pharmacist, and again by the medical assistant at the mental health clinic--that this couldn't be the case.  Is it more likely that I'm just going through another mood swing?  Is it just a coincidence?  I would feel more at ease, knowing if I'm imagining things or if anyone else has experienced similar results.  I remember my psychiatrist telling me, long ago, to beware of muscle relaxants, but she didn't elaborate at that time.  (I have a genetic disorder which causes painful, intermittent, muscle contractions throughout my body--occurring at just about anytime and for just about any reason.  Thus, the need for this type of drug in the first place.)  So, I'm at a loss for any explanation, or even an opinion on this topic.  Anyone?</em></span></span></span></p>
