<p><span style="color:#000080;">You're fortunate to have found an antidepressant that is always effective for you, (((surfergirl))). But I know what you mean about the inner conflict over taking mood meds. I've also tried a few times to go off antidepressants, and although I don't get withdrawal symptoms, I always begin to sink back into the depths. At this point, I'm pretty much at peace with needing medication for life.</span></p><p><span style="color:#000080;">There is a lot of speculation about the long term effects of antidepressants, but nothing is conclusive as of yet. There are studies, however, that show that depression actually kills brain cells, and antidepressants help to regenerate them. How about that? You can find the studies yourself if you Google "antidepressants" and "neurogenesis".</span></p><p><span style="color:#000080;">Even aside from that, I figure that being on antidepressants is far better than abusing alcohol or other drugs to self-medicate my depression and anxiety away. And even if it turns out that decades down the road I run into some problems because of the meds, I still would much rather have lived all these years in a healthy state of mind, rather than praying for death everyday, which is what I used to do. That's not a life worth living.</span></p><p><span style="color:#000080;">Also, there are new antidepressants being developed all the time. A whole new class of them is due out in a year or two. So for those who tend to develop a tolerance to them, there will be more choices as time goes on.</span></p>
