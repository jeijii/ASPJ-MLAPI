<p>So, I've been struggling with depression for a while now (like a couple of months) and I am tired of living like this. I have extreme amounts of social anxiety to the point where I won't even want to go anywhere because I hate being around people. Then I go home and sit alone wondering what it would be like to be normal and to go out and do things. My parents don't really help me much, my mom tries to help me, but she doesn't understand enough to really do anything. My dad doesn't even try to understand and just assumes my condition is something I can "get over" and that I'm just being overdramatic. I went to a psychologist, but he didn't really do much of anything. I told him about my anxiety and how it brings me to depression, but all he did was do relaxation techniques that didn't really do anything. So recently I have been thinking about going on medication. I asked my mom to set up an appointment with the doctor, but my dad thought that was stupid and told me that "pills won't make anything better". My dad also told me that the only reason I feel the way I do is because I'm a teenager and I'm going through puberty. But I'm 16 and am pretty sure I already went through puberty. I am trying to get a second opinion. Is it right to try medication? And how do I go about getting it? I don't even like talking about it because part of my brain thinks I'm just being a little baby and that people would laugh at me for wanting to get pills. But on the other hand, I know that this isn't how life should be lived. I shouldn't be down all the time and shouldn't be scared to go places. I am just so confused. If anyone could give me any information in this regard it would be really helpful.</p>
