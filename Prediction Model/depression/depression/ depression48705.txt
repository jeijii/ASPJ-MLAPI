<p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">First off, thanks to everyone who has posted so far. It has been extremely beneficial to me to hear advice first hand from people who have experienced what i have not yet. So thank you.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">Lightsphere, </span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">You asked, "</span><em><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">Are you looking for fairly practically directed, strategy type therapy or in more free associative talking?</span></em><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">" In all honesty i have no idea what that means. What would a fairly practically directed strategy type therapy be like? Or free associative talking? Does the first one mean i would follow the therapists approach to healing and the second meaning i do most of the talking? I have never been to a pdoc or known anyone personally who has so I'm kind of leaning on DF at the moment to guide me through. But yes besides that, everything else you wrote made sense and i like the idea of bringing in something I've written before hand (if the pdoc i choose will accept it) that sounds like a good idea. Also i agree strongly about if in my first session with a pdoc i was prescribed medication right of the bat i would refuse, i would want the pdoc to get a good insight to where my head is at before putting me on mind bending drugs! Ha, that sounds silly. But yes, thank you so much for your advice.  </span><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_shocked.gif" alt=":shocked:"></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">Iowa,</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">What is DBT and CBT? Sorry I'm not very updated on the acronyms, i just recently found out what </span><em><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">pdoc</span></em><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';"> means. But yes, from everything else i read it sounds like a good idea to make sure that my pdoc is known to be good with pharmacology. Also the religious background is a good point, that didn't even cross my mind. I am a atheist so i wouldn't want religion to be brought into my sessions. Also i am never busy so at least I'd be available for any appointment any time. Anyway, thanks for your advice iowa.  </span><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_huh.gif" alt=":huh:"></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">Bravetwilight,</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">I'll be sure to ask that question, about why i should choose that particular pdoc. Your right, i wouldn't want to waste my time and there's so I'll try to be straight to the point when i call. Also I read your reply on </span><em><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">Am I Depressed?</span></em><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';"> about this topic so I'll just reply in full there! Again thanks for the advice, really need this!  </span><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_wwww.gif" alt=":wwww:"></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">Deepster,</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';">You have a good view point, i liked how you would research everything before hand. I think I'm kind of like that too, i love to research pretty much everything on the internet. So I'll defiantly keep that in mind if i end up getting prescribed something, I'd have to research it and what not. Also yes, i wouldn't want my pdoc to walk all over me, i would want as much say in matters pertaining to my own life as the pdoc does! Also only 10-15 minutes with a pdoc? Really... i thought they went by the hour. 10-15 minutes doesn't seem like any time to introduce yourself, express your pain then know if the pdoc is right for you!! Great now just one more thing to add to my nerves. *sigh* But yes, thanks for your input Deepster, i really appreciate it.  </span><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_sneaky2.gif" alt=":sneaky2:"></p><p></p>
