What can we do to help our hormones?  Is there a diet that we can eat?  I have been tested a few times for thyroid and it all came up negative but there are times I just feel my hormones are out of whack because I get so irritable.   Any thoughts?</div></blockquote><p>Well, could be something missing from your diet or perhaps you use too much caffeine (or maybe anything else?). You just seem to be in the same boat that we're all in and that's why we take medication for depression or anxiety or both. Some people don't like to take drugs for these problems and that's understandable because they do have some side-effects. I don't think there really is a specific test to tell which hormone or neurotransmitter we are short on (except for estrogen and some related to that) and that's why we go thru this trial and error process to find which drug will help. If you go to a psychiatrist I'm sure they will be able to help as there are many fine medications on the market and new one coming along every few years. Keep us posted on your condition...we care! <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_shocked.gif" alt=":shocked:"></p>
