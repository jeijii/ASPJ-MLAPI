<p>Hi all,</p><p>I just found this thread so I had to comment and vote.</p><p>Ok, I have a long history of problems with looks, but not so much from myself as from others.</p><p>I was born with deformities in my face which have pretty much been corrected, but I was teased a lot about my looks in my childhood and youth and for a long time, even today, I have a hard time with my looks at times.</p><p>When I got married I was really skinny, I lost weight due to a surgery that I had to have (which hadnt anything to do with losing weight, it just was a side effect of the surgery) and then when I got put on meds for my anxiety I gained a ton of weigth and now Im carrying it all around with me!</p><p>Anyway, the thing is, my body has changed, but I am still me, so the body isnt all that, its in the head and in the heart.</p><p>I may have probs at times with looks from other people (I always interpret it as staring at me because they think Im ugly, due to the fact that so many have done this when I was younger) and comments (I get a lot of dumb comments from time to time) but, I try not to care about it anymore. I am me, take it or leave it.</p><p>Evin :)</p>
