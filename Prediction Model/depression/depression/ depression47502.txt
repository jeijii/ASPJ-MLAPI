Please let us know how it goes and I hope it helps.</p><p>Trace</p></div></blockquote><p> Well I tried the anti nausea pills and they made me sleepy. I took one with paxil before bed and it took about 24 hours for the side effects of the anti nausea pill to wear off. I didnt actually throw up this time, but i was still nauseated. It was definately better with the pills, but i had to call in sick to work again, because i couldnt stay awake long enough to even drive there. I am really easily influenced by pills in general. my body has a strong reaction to every medication so i'm not suprised.</p>
