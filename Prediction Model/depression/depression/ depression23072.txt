<p>Here's a little update.  Well I ended up getting worse as the days went by and even though 50mg 5htp for 3x a day did calm me down it didn't help with the panic attacks.  I was still having them in my sleep and whenever I worried about being home alone and was hyperventilating/freaking out.  Went to my doctor and he put me on 0.5mg Klonopin/clonazepam 2x day for the next 2 weeks.  Not sure whether I should still take the 5htp along with it considering I have a bit of depression too.  I am feeling much better, still a little anxiety and my OCD is still here but I am worried about taking a benzo and its addictive nature.  It does make me sleep better but makes me dizzy during the day.  Will this go away?  I am also afraid of gaining weight on Klonopin, is that possible?  I think the doctor wants me on it till the prozac is out of my system.  I think I'm at 24 days prozac free and I think it takes about 45 days to exit the system.  Either way, I am very afraid of the weight gain.  Please help me, thanks.</p>
