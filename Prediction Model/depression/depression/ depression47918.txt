<p>Thanks, maybe i'm being paronoid, on prozac a week, woke up last night after an hour asleep, and felt real panicky, shortness of breath, felt really tired but kept awake coz was afraid if i went to sleep something bad might happen, also felt hot then shivers, starting to wonder if meds gona work for me and if i have a problem takin them. Also one last thing kinda was took an illegal party drug prior to taking this, like 3 weeks ago i wondering if this has had an effect. <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p>
