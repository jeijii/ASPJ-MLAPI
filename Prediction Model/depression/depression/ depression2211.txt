<p>I'm on topirimate (25mg) and xanax ( .25mg, split in half and taken every 3 hours. Total 1mg a day). </p><p>I'm working on weaning off the topamax because I think it may be the cause of some (if not all) of my stomach conditions, because they started soon after I went on topamax about 5 years ago. </p><p>I'm having a rough time with withdrawals. To make matters worse, I'm already very ill- after a heavy-duty round of antibiotics for a bad kidney infection, I've been in rough shape. I have gastroparesis which is exacerbating my acid reflux/ibs. I think the gastroparesis is starting to get better, but I'm still pretty sick. </p><p>I've found that I need to go painfully slow on the topirimate. I took 1 week alternating .75 with 1 pill every other night, then the next week went down to .75. That was too fast, even, and I was horribly nauseated and had bad reflux all week. I'm finally starting to feel better. I think I need to take at least 2 weeks for every 1/8 pill. It's going to take me a very long time to get off this crap. :( </p><p>Meanwhile, I developed the dependency to xanax during the kidney infection. I know that the longer you are on it the harder it is to come off, but the priority is to get off the topirimate because it's probably causing more health issues. I don't like the thought of being on the xanax for many months because I know that will only make it harder to get off. I'm terrified of withdrawal. I am extremely sensitive to medications, and I know that benzo withdrawals can be pretty awful. </p><p>I worry a lot about both drugs-about going off the topamax now, and the xanax eventually. I'd really love to hear some success stories to keep me from worrying so much. Tell me stories about getting off meds where you had little withdrawal effects (or none!) I am prepared to go very slow getting off these meds, but am also discouraged about how long it will take, and how much suffering I will probably have to endure to do it. </p>
