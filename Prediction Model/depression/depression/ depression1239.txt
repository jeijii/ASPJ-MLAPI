I have a similar problem.  With me  - it seems as if as soon as I start feeling well, I forget to make taking my meds a priority.  I'm not sure why it happens but it happens every single time.  I crash each time , and then I become painfully aware of what a mistake it was to let the meds slide once again.  It's a vicious cycle with me.  I really think that subconsciously I haven't completely accepted that I will have to stay on meds to maintain stablility.  Perhaps I'm stubborn, or have to learn things the hard way, or just feel like....oh...I can control this without meds...but every single time I go without meds I crash.   So for me, I think I just need to begin to view my meds differently - like my lifeline - and as important as the oxygen I need to breathe each day....maybe then I won't forget.  I've also resorted to writing on my bathroom mirror with lipstick "TAKE YOUR MEDS!!"...because  i think alot of the problem is simply that we just get busy with everyday "life" sometimes and we just space it, you know? <p>Much love....Shanban   <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p></div></blockquote><p>Shan,</p><p>Well I dont wear lipstick so tha ideas out !!!! LOL</p><p>Yeah. I'm exactly the same. Feel better - not  priority.</p><p>I've found putting them by my toothbush works well now,..</p>
