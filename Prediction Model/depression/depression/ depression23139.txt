<p>Sounds like u are well on top of things at the moment, that is very encouraging to hear :) I am still on the same dosages 30 mrt and 225 eff and my pdoc wants me to stay there for a while. I really want to get the effexor to the 375 mark ASAP with or without his consent. I am going back to work this week so I won't be changing anything this week as I don't want the anxiety to increase. I just can't wait to start feeling like I'm my old self again. I think cbt can be helpful to some ppl that are self-critical and lacking confidence. That isn't the case with me at all, well my confidence has taken a hit but that's only because of the severe anxiety. I would like to see a person that wouldn't be effected by it! Lol Anyway hang in there and I will keep updating my progress. Best wishes to your mum</p>
