<p>I've had a combo of Xanax and Seroquel which is an atypical antipsychotic like Abilify, but I was taking a low dose of Seroquel for sleep and have since switched to Trazodone, which is much better because Seroquel had an awful hit or miss effect, that night be night it wouldn't help me get to sleep, or I'd sleep for 14 hours. </p><p>You're on a very low dose of Xanax though for taking daily, considering it has such a short half-life. I'd ask your doctor about starting .25 Klonopins instead next time since they last much longer, or 5 mg of Valium which would be about equivalent. </p><p>All I can tell you is that Seroquel and Xanax don't potentiate each other. Xanax produces a sense of tranquility whereas Seroquel produces just an empty mind and lethargy. Your paranoia might be caused by anxiety or it might be caused by manic tendencies, if you've been on mood stabilizers before without an SSRI or other antidepressant, I'd imagine you might have received a bipolar diagnosis had you asked. Xanax and Abilify should, in theory, each play a separate part in calming anxiety, but for different reasons and won't potentiate or negate one another. </p><p>As for me, I'm currently on an SSRI, NDRI, SARI and a benzo and it seems to be keeping me stable and mellow without inhibiting my capacity to get things done. Only side effect I deal with is some lethargy but it beats insomnia by a long shot, which ends up producing lethargy in and of itself.</p>
