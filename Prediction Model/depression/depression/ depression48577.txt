If you're just skipping a day of Celexa and then starting Cymbalta you might not be too bad. If you were planning to stop Celexa for a few days before starting Cymbalta I'd be careful to taper. As soon as I started Cymbalta all my Celexa withdrawal symptoms went away pretty quickly.</p><p>Standard disclaimer that I'm not a doctor or anything, just my own experience :P</p>
