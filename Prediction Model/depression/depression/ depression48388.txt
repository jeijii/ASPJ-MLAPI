It took me several months</p><p>to get back to feeling normal but in the end the effexor</p><p>worked and it was worth being on 3 at the same time.  Of</p><p>course my doctor kept a close eye on the situation.</p><p>Now I am back on zoloft and wellbutrin with 5mg of abilify</p><p>and I feel great.  The abilify worked wonders for me.</p><p>I hope you feel better soon!</p><p>best wishes,</p><p>starr</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>am taking cipralex 10mg daily</p>
