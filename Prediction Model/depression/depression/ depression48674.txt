Current studies show that only aged cheeses and meats, fermented foods, unpasturized alcohol and some red wines need to be completely avoided.  She says that chocolate and coffee are ok in moderation, along with bottled alcohol and white wines.</div></blockquote><p>My psychiatrist says the same thing but also suggested not eating sauerkraut and soy sauce.  I'm needing to go from 9 mg. to 12 and am really fearful that I'll screw up.  There really needs to be more info put out on EMSAM because it has saved my life!  There are times my depression is so bad that I want to die, but then I quickly discovered that I don't' want to while trying to get better!!  Why can't the company do a website wehre you can type in a food, herb, or medication and get an answer.  I guess they have to be overly cautious and do the old CYA.</p>
