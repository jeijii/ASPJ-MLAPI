<p>I've been on Lexapro just under a month, so it's hard to say how I'll feel about meds over the long haul. Right now, I can't believe that I waited so long to get an antidepressant!! If it's going to take being on them forever to stop cycling in and out of depression, then I will seriously consider staying on them.</p>
