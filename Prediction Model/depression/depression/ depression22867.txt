<p>I've been on Emsam 6mg for exactly two weeks and I'm exhausted.  I would be sleeping all the time but for the fact that I'm drinking about 3X as much coffee as usual.  i keep waiting for this energy to kick in that everyone keeps talking about.  i'm assuming it's because i just got off of wellbutrin and ritalin . . . </p><p>which made me curious about Kingston's post...the part that made sense anyway (JK).  i guess if i needed wellbutrin and ritalin and coffee to function before then maybe i'm one of those extremely dopamine deficient people.  i don't know to what extent that should affect my decision, but in any event, i'm going to talk to my doctor about maybe going up to 9 mg tomorrow.  was wondering if anyone had any experience with this.  seems like most people noticed the energy boost (and resulting insomnia) right away.  maybe i should give it more time?</p><p>also, kingston, i'm really curious about your statements about Emsam lowering bp and about taking stimulants with it. i've had a super low blood pressure all my life (like 90/60 is pretty typical), but on the wellbutrin and ritalin my pulse was really high (resting 85-90 but sometimes well over 100, usually after eating), which is one of the reasons i wanted to find a new med--low bp + high pulse = uncomfortable.  now i'm worried about Emsam potentially making my bp even lower.  my doc made me get off the ritalin before starting Emsam.  anyone else have experience with Emsam and stimulants?</p>
