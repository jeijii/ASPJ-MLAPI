<p>I have taken VERY many different types of combinations from 2000 thru 2006.  Most of them take so long to show any effect; which makes it frustrating.  My best "med-change" has been recently.  I have gone OFF Zoloft (over 5 yrs use) - and added Wellbutrin.  I feel much better and dont have the "dark cloud" that I used to.  I am also taking codiene for pain and wonder if it is contributiong to my depression?  My doctor claims it shouldnt - but I dont know....?  There is no easy answer - eveyone has such a unique case.  After all, it is called "the practice" of medicine!</p><p>Dad</p>
