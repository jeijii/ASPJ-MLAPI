<p>Hi hopelessmommyandwife,</p><p>I know that Chiropractic has to do with aligning the bones in your spine.  The top bone in your neck is like a gate keeper between your brain and rest of your body.  So if the bone in out of alignment then perhaps that will effect the body or brain ability properly function in some way or another.  I am just guessing but maybe there is some kind of relationship between chiropractic and mental disorders.  Having your spine aligned mayl help with mental processes.</p><p>Lindahurt</p>
