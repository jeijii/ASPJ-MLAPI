There will come a time when you will realize it will not matter what weight you are becuase it will never be good enough and you will still be miserable.  I know because I have been there.  It was only after I stopped the binging and purging and let my body heal that I could maintain a healthy weight, excersise, and enjoy life again.  Hang in there and love yourself for who you are not what you look like!</p><p> <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p>
