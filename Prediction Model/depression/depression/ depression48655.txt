In fact it is often combined with SSRIs to offset those side effects. I take both Wellbutrin and Celexa/citalopram, and my sex drive and ability are just fine. But when I took citalopram alone, I definitely noticed a drop in my libido.</span></div></blockquote><p>I took a look @ Wellbutrin (stupid suggestive name) and all the other names it goes by (amfebutamone, Zyban) and I can't find any on Walmart's $4 list,  which is all I can afford now.  So that just means my life will continue to suck and be frustrating as usual <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_flowers.gif" alt=":flowers:"></p><p>PS To make my life suck even more I tried posting a link to Walmart's $4 list just so you can see what I'm talking about but this board doesn't allow me to post links  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p>
