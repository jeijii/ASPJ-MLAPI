When I say 'no apparent reason' I mean that I have not been through any significant event (for example past childhood abuse/ death of someone close to me) that was sort of a <strong>pin-point</strong> for me.</p></div></blockquote><p>I first went on prozac when I was about that age.  It was prescribed by a GP because no one in my family has ever had to go through any kind of treatment for mental illness, so my parents sent me to my regular doctor.  I don't really remember telling him how I felt or even talking much.  He just asked me a few basic questions about my mood and daily habits.  Then I was prescribed the AD without much further emotional/mental proding or questioning.  So I doubt that a lot of other GP's will question a patient any more than that when they come in with depression.</p><p>I think a psychiatrist is a safer choice cos they know more about how these medications affect people than a GP.  But if you really do feel uncomfortable about talking indepth about what you are dealing with, then going to a GP to get the meds would be better than going at it alone.</p>
