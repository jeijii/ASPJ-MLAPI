I am not scheduled to see him until Tuesday. I am not thrilled at the Ambien because I think it makes my depression WAY WORSE in the morning. Is there anything I can take Over the Counter?? I am scared to try because I had a bad episode with too much Benadryl. I am going to stop by there today to see if I can get in early..but who knows??I also take Lexapro</div></blockquote><p>Is lexapro the only other thing you take??</p><p>The best thing you can do is go the the pharmacy and ask the pharmacist what you can take and tell him/her what you were and are still on.  They are the best ones to tell you what you can and can't take together.</p><p>Sorry you're having trouble sleeping, that never helps with the anxiety!</p><p>Sweetest</p>
