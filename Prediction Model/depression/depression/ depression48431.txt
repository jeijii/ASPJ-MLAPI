<p>:bathbubbles: <span style="font-size:14px;">Hi there! just wanted to say hi and offer my support..as a survivor of the depression anxiety wars I can tell you it WILL get better! It is just so d*** hard when you're in it-I know! I have suffered thru so many episodes and set-backs,meds, drs,-it was a long-fought war!!! good news is I WON!!! Im 58 and have finally learned to live a healthy, peaceful life and to recognize if depression is returnin I better take it by the horns and wrestle it to the ground,lol! There is always a trial when starting new meds, I have probably been on them all at one time or another..I was in a hospital, catatonic, couldnt even get dressed myself 21/2 yrs ago. I didnt know what had happened to me this time! I had a great job was seemingly ok..but truly, no that I look back , it was a facade-all of it! I was in group therapy intensively, found a great woman therapist, a great psychiatrist, and continued working harder and harder FOR ME! I was not ever gonna have another depressive episode or wind up in hospital ever again! Was it easy? no! did it happen in a vacuum? no! there is light at the end of the tunnel, you just have to fight and I mean FIGHT for each moment, each day..because truly we deserve it!!! I never gave up even after 56 yrs..I knew their was a better happier life for me and d*** it I was gonna have it!!! im so gald to be able to give help or a shoulder to anyone who needs one..Ive been there most of my life so I know from whence I speak...nothing is hopeless, we have to be strong and not victims! ask for help you need, try everything at least for awhile and eventually you will have the meds, therapist, etc you need for yourself..its tough on families, I know! they do not understand-they need to be educated so when you have a bad day_and you will, its not a perfect life-they will have compassion instead of anger towards the situation. so, anyway-if you are lonely Im here always-email me anytime-and also, I am private, loyal person-it stays between us only..Jonie xxoo</span></p>
