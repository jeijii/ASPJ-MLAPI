<p>Just about one year ago, I quit taking Tramadol, cold turkey, though I don't recommend this, but in my situation, I wasn't able to wean because I was abruptly cut off by my doctor.  He had prescribed them to me in the beginning of 2012.  At first, I didn't take them every day.  They made me feel really good, but after a few hours I often got nauseous and they caused me to vomit.  So I'd stop them for awhile.  Then I'd remember the good feeling I got, then attempt to take them again.  </p><p>Eventually, I got used to them and the nausea went away.  They put me in a really good mood and I took only a few of them every day for several months, but then, almost overnight, my tolerance increased rapidly.  I started going into withdrawal every time I tried to cut the dose down, so I felt trapped into taking them. The problem is it took more and more to get the same affects and the time came when my dr said "enough."  Ironically, when he prescribed them to me, he said they were not addictive!  It's written everywhere that quitting Tramadol cold turkey can cause seizures, but he gave me 40 pills to withdraw and that was it.  I tried very hard to wean, but there simply wasn't enough of them to wean slowly.  I was getting bad withdrawals from cutting down too quickly, so I was only able to go from ten pills to five in a day before I ran out for good.  I'd experienced some withdrawal with them before, but I always ended up getting more to stop it.  </p><p>This time, I was out of luck and I really wanted to quit.  Now, I was scared to death of the impending withdrawal symptoms I'd read about.  And every word was true!</p><p>Tramadol i</p><p>s not a controlled substance yet, but it should be!  The withdrawal was worse than any opiate I'd abused.  My legs wouldn't stop jiggling.  I literally could not keep in one position for more than a few seconds.  I had these electrical-type "zaps" going through my brain and horrible tingling throughout my legs and fingers.  I had profuse sweating and took showers every twenty minutes.  I couldn't sleep for over 24 hours.  It looked like I had some severe flu.  Not to mention the depression that set in.  I tried to get into a detox but couldn't find one to accept Tramadol addiction, so I toughed it out for over 24 hours and finally, the withdrawal decreased alot.  But moderate withdrawal symptoms continued for several weeks, and the depression was almost unbearable.</p><p>It has been a year since I've taken any Tramadol, and I can honestly say I will never touch one again!</p><p>What I hate is that my doctor wasn't aware of it, but then when I built up a tolerance and told him that, he treated me as if I should hang my head in shame.</p>
