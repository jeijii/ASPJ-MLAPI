<p>I'm suffering from treatment-resistant depression and my daily cocktail is Remeron, escialopram and bupropion + clonazepam. What are your experiences with using stimulants in depression? I'm thinking of methylphenidate and amphetamines (modafinil doesn't work for me anymore). Do they work long-term?</p><p>Thanks.</p>
