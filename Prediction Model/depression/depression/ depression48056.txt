<p>I've been on meds for about 20 yrs. It would have been longer but when I was a teenager I was always told by doctors "you're too young to be depressed". Thankfully for you younger ones they think a bit differently these days. I still haven't found the right meds for me. I have to change every few years when they stop working, and nothing seems to completely lift the black fog.</p><p>I will definitely be on them for the rest of my life.</p>
