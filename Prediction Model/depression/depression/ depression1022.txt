Adjusting to the weather. The summers and springs are so pleasant here, because there is light all night. I feel revitalized by this light as soon as February and it brings mystical and magical energy.</p><p>The winters can be absolutely horrifying. Hurricanes, snow blizzards, terrible cold and windy days and no sun, we get only 3-4 hours of sunlight towards the end of the year.</p><p>I used to get really down by the weather when I was depressed. Now I work around it. I make sure my house is comfortable and that I dress well, something I didn´t take care of when I was depressed. I like gardening and love my garden, so I love to have lights on the veranda and in the windows when it starts to get really dark. I like the coziness of darkness. But on a bad day, it can be really awful and there is nothing to do but hold tight.</p><p>Being housebound is the worst for me. Sometimes in January we have winter storms that are so bad, we cannot go out. That can be difficult. I see you´re in Newfoundland and it is supposed to be similar to Iceland. My advice is look at the winter to accomplish some goals, work steadily towards bringing your projects forth in the spring. It´s a farmer´s mentality and it can be helpful.  I have various projects this winter, both for myself, my kids, my work, my exercise routine, hobbies, my garden (I´m growing various fruit trees) and such.</p><p>I like taking photographs and during the dark days I like to take photos to get to know the various shades of grey and dull light. I can usually find something positive in it.</p><p>Wishing you the best.</p><p>Violet</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Hi Violet</p><p>We do get pretty dark winters here but not as dark as yours. December 21 sees approximately 8 hours of daylight (all of which is spent at work LOL) and it seems to never increase until April.</p><p>There's an exp<b></b>ression here that goes "it's a winter project", which to us means if it can be done inside save it for the winter, otherwise stay outdoors.</p>
