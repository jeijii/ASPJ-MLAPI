<p>A traumatic premature birth. [i nearly died.]</p><p>Being separate from my mum until I was a month old, and then wasn't with her all the time until I was out of hospital at 2 months old.</p><p>Mum's post-natal depression and PTSD.</p><p>Inherited and environmental - both parents had undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues/depression and anxiety.</p><p>Decades of emotional abuse and emotional neglect. </p><p>Witnessing domestic violence between my parents - dad the perpetrator.</p><p>Over a decade of bullying at school, every single day. Ridicule and alienation, and physical assaults of various kinds. The teachers did nothing.</p><p>Due to *everything* getting into the wrong career which I ended up staying in 12 years, because I was trapped. This re-traumatised me - I was a primary school teacher in some very rough schools, and was bullied all over again by children.</p><p>Basically, just over 3 decades of being in situations where I was powerless and victimised. Loneliness.  I'm 38 now, and in the past 6 years and counting, I'm starting to have some control and power back in my life. </p><p>As you can probably see, my depression was cumulative, alongside the development of more deeply embedded complex PTSD, too.</p>
