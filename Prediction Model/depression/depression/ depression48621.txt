	I am 32 and have been dealing with depression and anxiety for many years, have been on a lexapro/wellbutrin combo for some time after trying many, many different antidepressants and have found this to be helpful. I also take Klonopin as needed for days when anxiety is increased.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>To get to the point: what can be added here to help with the anxiety?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	The background: This week I have had crippling anxiety, like shut in a dark closet curled in a ball for hours, trying to work and getting some day to day things done, but other times just not able to face even the smallest things or function. Today at work I developed a headache that then turned into a crazy migraine and full blown-panic attack. I passed it off as just a migraine, thankfully avoided being too embarrassed, and my husband came to pick me up and took me to see my family doctor because I was having some other migraine symptoms (uneven pupils for a bit, shaking, high blood pressure, etc.) who said it was a migraine brought on by a panic attack. I spent the rest of the day curled up in bed.
</p>

	My psychiatrist is, of course, on vacation. I see her infrequently because she no longer accepts my insurance and I pay out of pocket because I've known her for so long, but at the suggestion of my family doc will be looking for a new psychiatrist I can see more regularly. Someone from my current psychiatrist's office is supposed to be calling me tomorrow. My family is leaving for vacation this weekend, so I will not be able to see either my currently psychiatrist or establish with a new psychiatrist for some time, but I really want to be able to be there for my husband and son and not just sleep/hide half the time, I want to be able to function.
</p>

<p>
	So, that's why I'm here. I won't have an opportunity for a full visit/eval to come up with a new long term plan before leaving for vacation and just desperately want to be able to make it through for the sake of my family. What can I do short term? Is there something I can request if I talk to the other psychiatrist on the phone tomorrow? Does anyone ever add anything anxiety specific to that combo, like buspar? I've taken that before with little effect, but never in combo with other meds. Afraid to make any big changes right before vacation though.
</p>

<p>
	Please, please, PLEASE share any thoughts or experiences that might be helpful. Desperate to find some short-term relief until things can fall into place for a long-term plan.
