<p>Well, I was doing good on Remeron and Ativan and now I have been off both for 2 weeks and I am sinking back to where I was before I started.  I was only on Remeron for 6 weeks and Ativan for 2 months.</p><p>I started to develop gynecomastia (pain in the breast area) so stopped the meds.</p><p>I am thinking now that dealing with the breast pain may be worth being out of depression and free from severe anxiety that has me house bound.</p><p>Back to my question, has anyone here taken meds for X months and also done therapy and other ways of coping and made it off the meds successfully and carried on as they were on the meds?</p><p>Are meds a life time committment in most cases?   I sure hope not...</p>
