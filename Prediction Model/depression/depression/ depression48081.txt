I think i might be bipolar-ish too, but she said there is no certain way for us to know that, we will just keep on trying meds.</p><p>did you feel the benefits right away ? any symptoms i should watch out for ? any suggestions ?</p><p>Thanks a lot, I truly appreciate your help.</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Only thing to watch out for really is the rash that your doctor should've told you about.</p><p>In terms of benefits, it made me hypomanic/start cycling pretty much right away which isn't really desirable. So you might find it works for depression for you right away.</p><p>It has taken 400mg to make me pretty stable, but antidepressant effect tends to be somewhere between 100-200.</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Well having been on Zoloft for many years, the side effect that troubled,me the most was insomnia initially....I was given Klonopon for that. The insomnia subsided after a few months. The only othe issue I had was constantly tapping or wiggling my toes. I found Zoloft very helpful, but my dosage never went over 80mg. You should get periodic blood testing to see how your kidneys are handling the high dosage . The othe thing is if you begin to feel manic, call your doctor ASAP. Good luck</p><p>Paul</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Hey Paul, </p><p>I do get my blood checked regularly, and I think every AD that i have been on, i was on almost the highest dose " not due to the severity of my depression but my body simply doesn't respond to low doses of any kind of meds and it tends to tolerate medications rather quickly.  Zoloft hasn't triggered any manic episodes, it honestly hasn't done ANYTHING yet, it hasn't even caused any side effects lmao, but maybe now it will be more helpful since i added Lamictal to my treatment.</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>The Lamictal adjunct seems to be quite popular especially with Ad resistant patients. Success rate is really high...I think you will respond well...good luck and let us know how it works out.</p>
