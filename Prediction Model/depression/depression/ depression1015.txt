<p>Hi!</p><p>I've tried it twice, once from Ebay in powder form, mixing teaspoons or tablespoons of the stuff with drinks. I do not recommend this AT ALL, since it tastes awful.</p><p>The next time, it was in pill form.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend it myself. For Parkinsons, they combine it with carbidopa so it would reach the brain instead of stay in the body (or something like that).</p><p>On it's own, I never felt anything from it. My doses ranged from one pill (300mg mucuna pruriens with 15% L-dopa, so 45mg l-dopa) to around ten or more at once and absolutely zero effect. Apparently, L-dopa can also have adverse effects such as that the body will make less dopamine itself and neurotoxity.</p><p>So if you want to boost dopamine, I think other dopamine precursors, such a l-tyrosine and phenylalanine, would be better. <br>I haven't noticed much effect from them myself - with L-tyrosine I got slightly hyperfocused after ingesting too much, but no obvious effects.</p><p>I thought phenylalanine made me a bit more cheerful one time at a high dose, but that could also have been a placebo. <br>I am somebody who searches for immediate relief though (I am very impatient), and I haven't took the substances for a long time. Also, what doesn't work for me might as well work for others, so you can give it a try. </p><p>Others options are natural mao-a/mao-b inhibitors (such as St Johns Wort/Passiflora), maybe along with a natural dopamine reuptake inhibitor (<b>Japanese quince) </b>and something that increases dopamine receptor density (<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;">Sulbutiamine). Personally, I haven't tried them yet (apart from St Johns Wort, which didn't work for me but seems to work for some people), but I am planning to try them along with Rang Chuet (a flower that is supposed to raise dopamine levels in the brain), and I will post about my experiences if anyone is interested.</span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;">Good luck with it.</span></p>
