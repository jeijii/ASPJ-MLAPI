	I loved Paxil when I was on it.  I had no weight gain, and what sexual side effects I did have went away after about 8 weeks.
</p>

<p>
	The trouble began when it suddenly just stopped working.  It worked like a charm for six years, then dropped me off a cliff, so to speak, and I had a long way to climb out of it.

<p>
	Try taking it at night when you have your next day off.  If you find it keeps awake, take it during the day.  I always took mine at night, and was sorry to have to leave it behind.

	I now take Wellbutrin, and experienced unpleasant sexual side effects at first, but after about 3 months, my orgasm difficulty vanished. 
</p>

<p>
	My cue is that if an antidepressant--even for a few days--makes me feel panicked and s.u.i.c.i.d.a.l., I stop it immediately.  My doctor tried to add Brentellix to my already working Wellbutrin, and it was AWFUL.  I became weepy and hopeless and afraid I might end my life.  So, for now, it's just 300 mg. of Wellbutrin and 5 mg. diazepam, and most days I feel like I have hope for better things. 
</p>

<p>
	I wish you much success in this challenging time.
