<p>Thanks for the advice but my problem is I won't be able to get to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription until Monday... I'm pretty sure I won't feel suicidal but want to stop the side effects I get, electric shocks and weird shaky vision :(</p><p>I remember when I was cutting down Citalopram to change Sertraline I was having horrible side effects but as soon as I started Sertraline the sides went away. I have 20mg tabs of Citalopram so if I half it and take 10mg do you think it will be safe and stop or lessen any sides?</p>
