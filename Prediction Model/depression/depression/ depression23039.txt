<p>What's the general view on sleep patterns while depressed and whether napping is good or not?</p><p>I like napping anyway at the weekends, but right now I'm off sick and I feel tired a lot of the time, and it doesn't seem to be directly linked to how much sleep I have had the night before. Last night I went to bed at a reasonable time, read till I was sleepy, slept right through the night. And yet I still felt exhausted this morning. I didn't want to nap at all, I even drank some coffee, but I fell asleep and ended up sleeping 4 hours this afternoon! </p><p>If I fall asleep like that, after a good night's sleep and despite coffee, does it mean my body needs it and I shouldn't fight it? I'm sort of annoyed with myself because sleeping those 4 hours meant I missed out on going to the gym and on watching the film I had picked out as my afternoon treat. So I am wondering if napping could hamper recovery - if it stops me doing those good things.</p><p>I know sleeping a lot can be a symptom of depression. And also that antidepressants can influence sleep patterns. I am on prozac (20mg), I am generally a light and restless sleeper anyway so if it has been stopping me sleeping well at night, it hasn't bothered me that much. Maybe I am just sleeping but sleeping too lightly at night time and need these naps because I do feel better this evening than I did during the morning. Fight it, go with it? what do you think?</p>
