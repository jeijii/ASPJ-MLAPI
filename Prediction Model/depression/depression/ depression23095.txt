<p>Hi anne_of_green_gables,</p><p>The point is that  , rumination, cyclical anxiety thinking and obsessing cause the neurogenic specialized brain cells  that produce the 'happy hormones ' to become depleted. This is mainly due to the impact on REM Sleep Pattern (excessive REM Sleep)</p><p>This depletion then leads to the depressive state and this then becomes cyclical . SNRI, SSRI and other AD cause a slowing down of the reuptake of specific specialized neurotransmitters that are produced by the specialized neurons (serotonin , dopamine and so on) </p><p>ADs help you get your levels back up to the correct level again and therefore you feel much better. It is then necessary to deal with the events that led up to the rumination, anxiety, obsessing. So some form of therapy is required.</p><p>Best Wishes</p><p>Jim Bow</p>
