<p>Be careful if you go the natural route. Some people seem to think that because they're natural, they're safer.   And that's not always true.  They may be herbs, but some cannot be used together or with other meds.  Plus many meds originally came from herbs or other natural sources in the first place.  So, you know, still treat them as though they are medicines... because they can also have side effects and stuff.</p><p>All that said, I've heard some positive things about SAMe, Ginkgo Biloba, and St. John's Wort.  </p><p><strong>Other, less conclusive options:</strong></p><p></p><ul><li>Folic acid supplements (works well in women)</li><li>GABA supplements</li><li>Inositol</li><li>Omega 3s</li><li>Saffron (very expensive though)</li></ul><p></p><p>'Please PM Member for Links'</p><p>Please talk to a doctor first before trying to use or combine any of these herbs.  Good luck.  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.gif" alt=":smile:"></p><p></p><p><sub>I wouldn't try Effexor if you want to eventually wean yourself off of it.  That one is a hard antidepressant to get off of!!  It has withdrawal side effects that can last for days or weeks.  So maybe ask for a different antidepressant if your goal is to eventually</sub><sub> stop taking one.  :)</sub></p>
