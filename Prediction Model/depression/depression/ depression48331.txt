<p>Hi</p><p>I have been on a MAOI for several years now.  They have been a GOD-Send to me..BUT please at all costs FOLLOW the DIET.  It is very restrictive but if you don't follow it there are severe repercussions. </p><p>  MAOI restrict the bodies ability of getting rid of tyremene.  Tyremene affects your blood pressure.  Mine went to I think 200 over 160 once and It really makes for a headache morphin will not ****.   MAOI's are not prescribed very much because I think patients will not follow directions.  </p><p>   The drug  EMSAM is a MAOI in a patch form and the diet is not so restritive.  I live in the deep South and work outside mostly and the patches kept falling off.  So I had to go back to the pills.   I use one  called Marplan. I works for me.</p><p>The diet is my price for sanity and it is worth it too me.</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
