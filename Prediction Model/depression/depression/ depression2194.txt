I can tell you from experience, I would rather have had thoughts about suicide, rather than attempted it! When I was severely depressed, I was fixated on suicide and I was going through with it. Luckily I failed. QUOTE; "I laugh, I joke I go to work everyday." Your work could be helping keep you stable. My problems increased when I couldn't work any longer. QUOTE; "Also can someone be depressed and not have suicidal thoughts?"  I think that is possible.</p><p>Doug</p>
