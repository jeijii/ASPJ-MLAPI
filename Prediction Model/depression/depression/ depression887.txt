<p>my son has been on zoloft -- 50 to 100 to 150 mg before it gave out -- combined with 15 &amp; then 30 mg of remeron</p><p>he is currently on 40 mg of prozac</p><p>none of them have changed his core personality which i see as different from your emotions.</p><p>he did stop lexapro after a week because he said it made him feel "dead" inside</p><p>he has an undiagnosed periodic psychosis -- maybe bipolar or maybe something else -- so i don't know if that makes him more similiar to you or not</p><p>but -- when the depressive symptoms have him -- he stops playing music or creating artwork -- he has no motivation at all</p><p>the ad's help him some there</p><p>they do help him smile more than normal -- so that could be the emotional blunting -- under normal circumstances before he was medicated, you would have to ask him if you wanted to know if he liked something or not, you could never tell just by looking</p><p>he has always had problems sleeping -- the remeron helped with that -- and now zyprexa for the psychosis helps with it</p><p>i don't know if a normal AD would help or not</p><p>he's still tired a lot of the time</p><p>he also has a dyslexia-like learning disability that affects his memory -- so it's hard to say for some of the issues</p><p>it has helped his social anxiety -- he doesn't actively pursue friendships yet, but he is able to function in public without appearing to panic</p>
