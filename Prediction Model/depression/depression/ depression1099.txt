<p>After a week of starting an Antidepressant I have changed my mind and am going to try something 'natural'. </p><p>I took Venlafaxine about 10 yrs ago for depression, which was caused mainly by a stressful ongoing situation and drug abuse. It saved my life and improved my life and I will always be grateful for it.</p><p>Recently I've had a stressful time and have been depressed and also had anxiety too. After putting it off for months I decided to see the Doctor and got a prescription for some Venlafaxine. But whilst taking it this last week or so I've been doing some research on the internet and have decided to stop taking the Venlafaxine for now and try something else, if it doesn't work, I can jst go back to the Venlafaxine. </p><p>I've been doing some research in the 'brain growth hormone' BDNF and also the NMDA receptors, and the relationship between these and the main depression neurotransmitters Serotonin, Noradrenalione and Dopamine. </p><p>In my research I have found the stress, exercise, illness and poor nutrition can affect the regulation of BDNF and the NMDA receptors and the depression neurotransmitters.</p><p>I have decided to try to increase my levels of BDNF by using exercise and curcuma.</p><p>I'm going to use Magnesium Taurate and Zinc Gluconate (aided by Vitamin D) to work as an antagonist of the NMDA receptors, therefore increasing levels of the said neurotransmitters. I'm also under the impression that Curcuma will have this effect.</p><p>I am going to try curcuma with and without piperine and see which works best, or rather, if it is necessary to use piperine.</p><p>In the past I have tried St John's Wort, I took the full 900mg per day of a very good brand and the only thing I got was sunburn. </p><p>The reason I am trying this alternive approach to depression on this occaision is that I beleive in this instance I have a mild imbalance of the neurotrnsamitters, but I beleive the cuase of this imbalance is down to viral and nutritional factors. Viral infection encourages macrophage production, which had an effect on TNF akpha and 5ht2a receptors as well as down regualtion of BDNF and also an effect on NMDA recpetors, but as yet I'm not sure what, perhaps excess gutamate in the brain? I'm not a scientist and al this is new to me!</p><p>The reason I think the nurtition is a factor is becuase I have a love of milk, - I love hot milky drinks! And in my research have found that milk is the wrong ratio of Calcium to Magnesium for the body. Also, I live in a place where we don't get enough sunshine, sometimes it is very dark with clouds for days on ened. During this time I will most certainly not have an adequate supply of Vitamin D. No matter how much Ca or Mg or Zn we consume, it cannot be absorbed with the hormone Vitamin D (which in itself is an anti-inflammatory). Hence my conclusion.</p><p>Well, I ordered my supplies yesterday so I will let you know how I get on. This is not an insult to Venlafaxine or any other AD, they really helped me once, and I'm sure they would help again. I just feel like I would like to give this a go.</p><p>Forgot to add I'm also going to try B vitamins, perhaps all of them, but for now I'm drinking a couple of glasses of Grapefruit jiuce each day which will provide lots of inositol.</p>
