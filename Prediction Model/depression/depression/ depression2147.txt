Is there anyone else who is depressed or has big financial debts to pay off that seem very overwhelming?   Please share.</div></blockquote><p>Yes, yes, and yes  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"> I am definitely in that boat. My depression and social anxiety have prevented me from working the past year now, and even the year before that I was losing jobs and quitting jobs left and right. So now, I am officially up to around $20,000 in debt, most of them being medical bills and student loans (which were worthless since I dropped out). It is very overwhelming and I do believe it is part of my depression. Especially when I am getting calls left and right from debt collectors and knowing that my credit is an absolute disaster. Those darn debt collectors can really be a pain in the butt too. They aren't understanding at all. Like, I will tell them I have 0$ and then they say... "so how much can you pay today?"  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"> lol What I like to do .... is just shred the bills I get and then they don't exist anymore for awhile  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_flowers.gif" alt=":flowers:"></p>
