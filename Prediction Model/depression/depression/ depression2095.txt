I have always wanted a puppy - I have had dogs all my life, but I always wanted a puppy of my own.  I dog-sit my brothers dogs when I can as well as other family members dogs (well, I used to, before the anxiety hit so hard).  Living with my parents I am not allowed to have a puppy.  I keep trying to explain to them that it may be the best thing for me.  I have had a guinea pig (my avatar pic) named Muffy who I adore.  I have had her for 4 years now, and even just having her in my room brightens me a bit.  However, you can't really run around and play with a guinea pig. haha.  <p>Anyways, my question to y'all is, do you use animal therapy to help pull you through the rough spots?</p></div></blockquote><p>Ohh I want one too. But one of my family members are allergic so that goes out the window.  I always wanted a Chow Chow.  If you don't mind me asking, what dog were you thinking of?  Maybe you can consider rescuing/adopting a dog from a pound.  I find that parents always say "no" till they see the dog and then they just become a part of the family.  Maybe you can introduce them slowly by taking them just to "look" at dogs.  Who knows, they can fall in love.</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>I want either a purebred pug or an english bulldog. :)  I loved the smushed faces. hahaha</p>
