<p>Hi</p><p>I have been debating the same thing but I am a 36 year old woman and wanted to settle down. The only reason I would refrain from going on them is because they can harm the baby or cause it defects so its a big risk to take.(unless you're a man) As I have now lost my relationship and have depression too I thought it'd give them a go, I need the anxiety/panic to stop, it's affecting my job, I'm not getting paid and I have a mortgage to pay etc....I don't feel anybody will take me on because of my panic, it's the reason none of my relationships work.</p><p>You feel great because the meds are working, if you wean off you have to understand you may have anxiety and panic as a side effect but you have to stick with it until its out of your system, do it in baby steps.</p><p>I can't even get on any meds they all mess with my head and make me so ill that I feel I'm going mad, there is no problem with being on them for life, if it makes you feel better then why not. They can lower the dosage if you do decide to have children. </p>
