I have tried some in the past Paxil, Pristique and celexa. And had a big decrease in my sexual drive. <p>Does anyone know which one has reported to having the least sexual side effects?</p></div></blockquote><p>Only your own body is going to know this "for sure".  I do know that SSRIs completely, totally destroyed even my desire, and it went right on to my "ability".  Since being on an SNRI(Pristiq) for about 10 months, I do know I have both desire and ability back.</p><p>SSRIs are notorious for decline in desire and ability.  But, all of us are different.  I have often inquired of my pdoc about WB, but since I have a history of hypomania she is VERY reluctant to put me on this med, as it also can affect anxiety, of which I have aplenty!  Even the other SSRIs would cause me to go off on two year periods of hypomania.</p><p>Talk to your Rxer openly about this issue.  They all know it's a primary factor in our "yes" or "no" responses.  Hiding nothing from  your docs is most likely to get you the end result you seek, as well as take care of all your MH needs.</p><p>Deepster</p>
