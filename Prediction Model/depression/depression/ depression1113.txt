I also didn't realize that the levels change so quickly in healthy people, but it makes sense. Just think how your mind works rapid-fire when it's at the top of its game, and how it slows to a dead crawl when mired in depression. Cheers.</p></div></blockquote><p>Hi MichaelBlue,</p><p>Thanks for drawing attention to this really interesting article. I completely agree that ADs are an essential part of depression treatment for most people (I know there are some people who can't tolerate them or who have had bad reactions). </p><p>Like you and many others here, I too resisted medication for a long time. I was scared of the unknown, scared of having side effects, scared of becoming "addicted", scared of the stigma, unwilling to support the giant pharmaceutical companies by taking their "drugs"......The list went on and on. I tried EVERYTHING "natural". I'm already a regular exerciser and have been running for over 20 years (but have never been able to outrun my depression and anxiety). I did yoga, I tried breathing exercises, I had tons of therapy. I tried absolutely everything.</p><p>It wasn't so much my depression that finally made me "give in" and try anti-depressants. It was my anxiety. My anxiety was really out of control and I started having full-blown panic attacks. Nothing "natural" I tried could even begin to make the slightest dent in my anxiety. </p><p>Ironically, it was also my chronic anxiety which prevented me from taking ADs (since I was scared of them). But, eventually, I bit the bullet and began taking them. That was over 10 years ago now and I've had different experiences with different ADs I've tried. Overall though, I do MUCH better ON AD's than off them. I totally believe that my brain chemistry is out of whack and that I need ADs to correct that.  Whenever I've come off ADs I've slipped right back into that hyper anxious state again.  Not that I'm "cured" on the ADs. I am still anxious and I still have low-grade depression. But I'm doing A LOT better than I was doing without the ADs.</p><p>Sorry to write such a long reply. It's just that I'm a very firm believer in ADs, yet I know that many people are scared to take them, as I was. It's so important for people to be aware that when it's our brain chemistry that's up the creek, we almost always need a chemical correction to put that right and we can't just "snap out of it" on our own. </p><p>Thanks for sharing all this. </p><p>Take care.</p><p>Joanna</p>
