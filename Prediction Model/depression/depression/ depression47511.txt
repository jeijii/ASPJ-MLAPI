<p>im only on 20mg and its been of no help,if anything im a bit worse so im going to stop,so guess that means i may be grumpy withdrawing but it aint that great being on them,i plan to do it drinking loads of water and eating fresh foods,maybe go for a sauna,have a week opf feel good things like that,WHICH might actaully make me start to appreciate life and my ME ness which would be better than waiting for drugs to wave wands</p><p>for gods sake,this is a negative response to prozac so,dont rely on it as the way everyone feels on the drug,it does help some peopl,i just dont think it the one for me.</p><p>before i was on a drug ,i think it was effexor,i responded well to it,it was several years ago,all i remember was the packet has suns and moons on,was this Effexor?</p>
