<p>i am particularly (and have always been) worried about this.  I have been on and off the same medication for 10 years.  You know, feel good come off and then relapse.  I previously (before meds) had four or five years between episodes and since medication the cycles seem to have come closer, so i can't stay off more than 2 weeks without relapsing now, so, I am a lifer. </p><p>Anyway, i always worry when i first go back on that firstly it won't work this time and secondly that if it does it will poop out.  I have trolled boards and some people say that they think they always eventually poop out - of course an anxious mind grabs that and fixates on it. Then i catastrophize it to the end point of 'nothing will work for me'</p><p>then i had a modicum of insight - they can't always poop out - the older TCA's have been around for 50 years and there must be people that have been on the same medication all that time - otherwise it would be more in the literature, not just the message boards which are often frequented by people not benefiting from their meds.  </p><p>does this make sense?</p><p>can someone tell me if they know of someone who has been on the same med really long term - like more than 20 years?</p>
