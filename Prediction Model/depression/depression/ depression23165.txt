<p>I don't really think dreams are the doors opening to the reality or that type of mumbo-jumbo (no offence to anyone), they're the images that appear when our subconscious mind is on work. Of course, there is a whole lot more into it but I can hardly be convinced that they mean more than they appear to be.</p><p>I often have nightmares, and constant blackouts. But none of the things I see makes sense. This mostly happens when I wonder around with a lot in my mind. My brain overloads and I think this is it's way of loading off.</p><p>ahopelessdreamer, you should try to go to bed when you're exhausted. I happen to **** all the nightmares when I'm tired. If I go to bed, and think too much before falling asleep, it always brings some screams afterwards. Take a warm bath, don't read anything in your bed and only lay down when you're sleepy. that might help. If not, I can only hope you can have a peaceful night. Good luck with the dreams. :)</p>
