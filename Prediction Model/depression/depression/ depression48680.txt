<p>Hi all,</p><p> </p><p>I have been waiting to see a psychiatrist for months to figure this out, my doctor knows the basics but isn't very helpful. I have generalized anxiety disorder (i think) and also panic attacks especially when driving in heavy traffic. The anxiety is because of some job/financial issues, and also because I have an irritable/ overactive bladder. My bladder normally doesn't bother me as long as I eat well though. I have had depression in the past, but not at the moment, just anxiety. Paxil worked last time (for depression), but I had bad side effects this time, tried celexa but it made my bladder much worse. Apparently one of the side effects is increase in the frequency of urination or amount of urine produced. Celexa seemed to be working other than that, but my bladder was so bad I couldn't sleep, so I want to try something else.</p><p>Are there other medications that do not have bladder/urinary side effects, and are good for anxiety? "T<strong>ricyclic antidepressants,</strong> such as amitriptyline or imipramine (Tofranil), to help relax your bladder and block pain." &lt;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-cystitis/basics/treatment/con-20022439" rel="external nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-cystitis/basics/treatment/con-20022439&gt;</a>they are used for more severe bladder problems, but I don't have any pain or anything, just a sensitive bladder. I don't know if tricyclic antidepressants are a good choice to use for anxiety, especially were I am used to SSRI's.</p><p> </p><p>When I had depression (first and only time) a combo of paxil and wellbutrin worked well. When I tried paxil for anxiety it seemed to make it worse, hyper and panic attacks/worry after a couple days on it, then zombie like and not able to move my body easily. Got off of that quickly. Strange how it was a different reaction to paxil this time. I tried celexa for depression last time and it didn't work, for anxiety it seemed to be working, but it really made my bladder worse. So I guess this time I am going to have to try something new for anxiety. Again, depression doesn't seem to be reoccuring at this point, maybe here and there when my anxiety is bad for a long time. As long as I am not working and have no stressful things going on I am fine. But the minute stressful things happen, or I need to talk about my anxiety/finacial/career issues I get pain in my neck and shoulders and arms, or I have panic attacks while driving in bad traffic, or I get sad or worry. I almost passed out when talking to a counselor about all the things going on in my life that was stressing me out. All of a sudden I got really dizzy and things got blurry.</p><p> </p><p>I want to find a medication that works for me so that I can get back to work, start paying my own bills again, make progress where I can and accept the things I cannot change and not worry about it. I want to make an educated guess when trying a new medication so hopefully I can find one that works sooner, instead of randomly trying them.</p><p>I guess I am trying to have control over something in my life, if I try hard to get better and keep researching and talking to people. It is the only thing I can do other than sit here and wait to see a psychiatrisit that may or may not be helpful. Frustrating.</p>
