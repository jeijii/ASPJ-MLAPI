<p>I am going to throw my 2 pennies in about Effexor, I loved it so much I didnt want to come off it. This was besides the fact it messed my liver up, made me put on a ton of weight and had the screaming ad dabs if i ever ran out of this medication!!! Coming off it was a living hell, and no would never ever contemplate going back on it again. </p><p>Its highly addictive and for me was probably one of the worst things in my life ever to happen. </p><p>Lynn</p>
