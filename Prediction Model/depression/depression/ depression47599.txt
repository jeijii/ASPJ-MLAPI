	Hi guys,<br>
	Quick question about depression medications.<br>
	I've been on and off a few over the years; Effexor, Sertraline, Prozac... they've all had about the same effect on my mood but I've found the side effects awful.<br>
	Extreme nausea, dizziness, and a feeling of being completely absent from myself among the worst.<br>
	Just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences and has advice on how to ease these side effects or if there are any medications people are on/have been on that haven't had serious side effects.<br><br>
	Thanks!<br><br>
	H<br>
