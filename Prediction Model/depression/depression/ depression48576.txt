<p>I wonder, rusty--Do you get enough sleep? Getting up at 3 a.m. in general would be hell for me . . . I have difficulty falling asleep and so don't get to sleep until 2 most nights. <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_shocked.gif" alt=":shocked:"> It's recommended that we get about 8 hours of sleep a night. Do you go to sleep at around 7 p.m.? If not, do you take naps? I mention sleep b/c, if you're not getting enough sleep, then perhaps getting more sleep could help you cope better.</p><p>Personally, I don't tell anyone but close friends and family about my anxiety and depression. Others are not so understanding; they think I'm making an excuse or exaggerating. I've found that most people who have never experienced these things, or not had someone close to them who's experienced these things, tend to be unsympathetic. In some ways, it can even bias them against you. So, I don't think it's a good idea to go around telling your co-workers unless they're close friends you know that you can trust. I have learned that the hard way. Then again, that's just me.</p><p>Are you going to therapy? If not, perhaps therapy could help you cope with what you're going through as well. I'd say to just keep doing what you're doing, taking meds and maybe adding therapy. And we've all got to work, so just do the best you can in that avenue. <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_wwww.gif" alt=":wwww:"></p>
