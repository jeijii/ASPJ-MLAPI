<p>Did I check myself into a hospital?  No!! But my husband did.  He took me to the ER and they wouldnt let me leave.  I got a little hostile about and they threatened to strap me down so I of course settled down and accepted the fate that was coming.  I was in there for two days.  Nurses waking me up to go to "group" after not sleeping half the night only to get up and listen to the "group" (much younger than me) discuss their alcohol and drug problems, which neither pertained to me.  I basically sat in the common room and froze my a** off coloring in coloring books.  Oh, and I got to paint a bird house, which had to be totally supervised - like we were going to eat the paint or something.  I hated it!  I told him if he EVER did it again I was gone!</p><p>Lost</p>
