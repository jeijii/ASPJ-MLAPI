<p>I have also suffered from Anemia at various times in my life, the last time was when my second child was born and I had to have an emergency C section, I had some superflous varicous vains in my tummy that bled and I lost more than double the amount of blood that I was supposed to. They gave me extremely strong iron tablets that I had to take for 3 months, my blood pressure was lower than it normally is and I was extremely tired and dizzy for quite a while. </p><p>They told me not to take generics, I must take the real deal, iron tablets (they were quite expensive), but they worked.</p><p>I hope you feel better Law055car</p><p>Trace</p>
