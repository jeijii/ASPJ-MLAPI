Kinda of silly, but I can't help worrying about it either.</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>This is something you have to ask your doctor and i cannot advice you in :-P</p><p>However; I have done some amazing research on the web, talked to neulogists and read more books last month then a psychiater does for its study. And i found several clues and research that after a AD poops out on you (which is btw hard to proof thats the real reason) it will work again after 6 months. These 6 months will "clean" your body and remove the tolerance. </p><p>This is however MY research and my conclusion. See a doctor for some real advice ;)</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>A lot of people's experiences here say otherwise. ;)  And I've never heard doctors talking about this 'theory,' though I have heard several talking about people needing to change meds after their old one fizzles out.</p><p>But who knows.  Does it still work if you're put on another antidepressant during the wash-out period?  Because a lot of people go downhill fast when their antidepressant stops working and might need to be put on another in the meanwhile... if they decide to try this idea.  (with doctor's approval and supervision of course)</p><p>I was put on Lamictal over the summer, and I think it's best to make just one change in my medications instead of 2 right now.  So I'm still on Pristiq, even though it <em><strong>never</strong></em> worked for me.  That way I'll know that any improvement is more due to the Lamictal than the Pristiq.  Maybe then I'll try going back on Prozac.  ^^</p><p>I hope Pristiq's withdrawal effects aren't as bad as Effexor's!! XD</p><p>Here's something I forgot to ask earlier.  Did your doctor consider increasing your dosage of Paxil first instead of switching to Lexapro?  Sometimes increasing the dosage helps when the original dose starts losing its effects.</p><p>Good luck with whatever you and your doctor decide! :)</p>
