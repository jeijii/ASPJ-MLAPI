<p>This is a very common side effect of many psychoactive medications and it is very frustrating!</p><p>Unfortunately the advice for managing weight while on AD's is the same as it is without AD's.   Eat more healthfully and find ways to move around more.</p><p>Are you in therapy as well as using medication? Could you perhaps work with your therapist to find other ways to cope with the emotions that tend to be managed now with food? It's very hard to change any habit unless we find a new behavior to replace the one we're trying to break. And for many of us, food has become a habit in managing our feelings. </p><p>Sometimes changing diet is easier if we focus on eating more 'healthy' foods and less on taking away bad ones. If you actually eat the healthy foods then you don't have the same urge to eat the less healthy ones and you don't have the room to eat them anyway. </p><p>My weight's been all over the map, but I've maintained roughly the same weight for the last 20 years, through a few major depressive episodes as well.  For me, a big part of staying in healthy habits boils down to exercise. When I'm exercising, I just don't have the urge to eat as much 'junk'.  And it keeps my naturally high-strung nature much more in check--kind of takes that anxiety edge off. </p><p>Exercise is easier than you might think to incorporate into your day. I think most people try too hard at first and either hurt themselves or overwhelm themselves and then give up. Exercise does not have to mean an hour at the gym.  Even going for a 10 minute walk is a start. Anything that you can do consistently is going to help. So if you think you can manage a 10 minute walk, then commit to that.  If you can do that each day for 3 days, try bumping that to 15.  And keep doing that until you are up to 30 minutes per day. Don't worry if you can't find a half hour in the day--break it up then and do one 20 minute walk and then a 10 minute walk later on.  </p><p>Anything that you can do to build muscle is a big help as well. You will see results very quickly, you'll feel both physically and mentally stronger, and muscles burns more calories even when you are doing nothing. Building muscle doesn't have to mean going to a gym and hanging out with 15 big sweaty guys.  You can do floor exercises, climb stairs, do push-ups against a wall--using your own body weight is fine at first.  There are a lot of tapes and DVD's that you can get quite inexpensively that can help you to learn a few exercises. </p><p>I really do think that most people get 'stuck' in trying to manage their weight because they try to do too much too soon, when small choices every day WILL get the job done. You didn't gain the wight in a day and you're not going to lose it in a day.   </p><p>Hopefully some of these suggestions help! I know what it's like to be struggling to lose and I do feel for you on this. </p><p>KA</p>
