<p>Well, I would like to say no to A/Ds.  The only thing is, the depression I get might have started from an experience or too much stress too quickly but then it snowballs and continues and continues and life is miserable.</p><p>So when I am depressed, I will do anything not to be.  When Im fine, I dont think about it.  But Im only fine after a severe depression because I took A/Ds.</p><p>I also heard that report about the brains of depressed people actually being different and missing something.  That is very interesting.  One of these days, they will know for sure whats going on.  </p><p>How about that stem cell research where they are not using embryos?  How cool is that?  One of these days in the future, we will be able to wipe out diseases and fix defective parts.</p><p>By the way, has anyone read "Singularity is Near".  It is quite interesting.  He states that if you can stay alive for the next 10 years, you will probably live a very long life due to all the new information they are getting and progress they are making in science and technology.  The first part is kind of heavy but then gets more simple.</p><p>Gentle Sun</p>
