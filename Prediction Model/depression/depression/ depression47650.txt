I'm assuming they took blood from your arm. Measuring serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine in your blood is useless because these neurotransmitters do not cross the blood/brain barrier. The amount of these transmitters in your body is not representative of transmitters in your brain. 5-htp can cross the blood brain barrier and since it is a precursor to serotonin theoretically it can increase serotonin in the brain. Some pleople claim it works, some folks claim it does nothing for them.</div></blockquote><p>Nope.... I had it done via urine test by a company called "NeuroScience"      neurorelief  dot  com is the website -  Is a blood test the only way they can test for it at the family doctors office?</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Hi RockingHard,</p><p>No, a doctor could also order a urine test as well, but research has shown that the amount of neurotransmitters in the urine, which does reflect the amount in blood, has no relationship to the actual amount in the brain. From rat studies it is known that the concentration even differ in different parts of the brain. As far as the web site mentioned above, they are doing those tests to sell vitamins and amino acids purported to cure depression as such. But what they are selling are compounds that are well known homeopathic treatments for depression and other MH issues. Somehow, I don't think I would really trust the results someone who was trying to sell something based on a test they "performed". </p><p>If the urine or the blood could show what the amounts of these neurotransmitters, why then don't our doctors take regular tests to determine how well our meds are working. Here's a little interesting tidbit, the use of alcohol increases the amount of serotonin in the urine of drinkers. And the research suggests that alcohol allows the blood brain barrier to leak serotonin and thus reduce the amount available in the brain. Maybe that is why it takes a few days of having the 'blaaahs' after a heavy drinking night. But it certainly should convince those on meds or just suffering from depression in general to avoid drinking.</p><p>BE Peace and BE Love... wayne</p><p>Sabbat Shalom</p>
