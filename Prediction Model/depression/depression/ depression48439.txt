<p>Reiki, for those new to it, is Japanese energy healing. It is based on the idea that we all have a life force, and if the life force is low, you will experience negativity. If you have a high life force, you will experience vitality and a newness.</p><p>Reiki has been used in well-known hospitals, such as my local Metro hospital, to treat patients, including my mother, who has breast cancer. It has also been adopted by the Sisters at our local convent healing center. Therefore, it does have a track record and reputation, and isn't all "alternative" or untried.</p><p>Anyway, I was wondering. I have tried Reiki and have felt a lot better after my treatments. However, I am considering ECT  now, and am wondering if Reiki would help with my side effects. Or, conversely, if I could use the alternative treatment Reiki instead of ECT and see if that works before turning to the risky and more controversial ECT (yes, even Reiki is less controversial, since it can't hurt and is so gentle). </p><p>What do you think? Should I give the Reiki treatments a go before or during my ECT? ECT is like a last resort for my bipolar disorder (they're trying to treat the depression portion right now), and I'd desperately like to find another way. I've tried medications, exercise, and everything else my pdoc has suggested. </p><p>What do you think? I'm so far of the opinion that I should give it a go as my first round before trying the ECT, and if I do have to have ECT, then try it to help with the side effects.</p>
