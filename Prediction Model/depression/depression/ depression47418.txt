<p>The "warning" first.  Not all AD's work equatably on depression.  I have known people who have opted for a cheaper medication and found that it just didn't work for them.  That being said, you might look for a list of anti-depressants on-line and their generic names.  Then call Wal-Mart about those that fall into their $4 category.  In the midwest, a grocery store (Hy-Vee) also offers $4 perscriptions.  I take paroxetine and get it for $4/month.  </p><p>   I strongly suggest that you research medications and ask about the $4/month offers.  These policies have been in place only a month or less.  </p><p>   That has me wondering if drug companies or pharamacies have been benefitting (more than they should) from perscriptions.  When I had shingles last year, I was charged over $100 for a 1 week perscription (although I have great medication insurance coverage).  I assume that was because it is the same one given to people with genital herpes.  What kind of discrimination is that?   I'm sorry but I get so angry about the cost of medications and insurance coverage.  I had a close friend that got genital herpes after she married someone not knowing that he had genital herpes.</p>
