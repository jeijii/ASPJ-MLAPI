That's why I stopped taking it, even on a tiny dose my sex life was obliterated.  I switched to a combo of Wellbutrin and Cymbalta and I have no sexual side effects from either.</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Henrithecat, Have you ever tried cymbalta on it's own?  That is what I am currently using and I would like a decrease in adverse sexual effects. The possibility of improvement by adding wellbutrin is intriguing to me.  I look forward to your reply.</p>
