<p>my son has been on zoloft &amp; prozac -- plus 2 others that are truely notorious for weight gain, zyprexa &amp; remeron.</p><p>the most he's gained is 5 lbs on the zoloft/remeron combo -- he's actually lost weight on the prozac/zyprexa combo.</p><p>but, he's not a big eater.</p><p>what they have done to him is make him tired &amp; unmotivated so he's not as active as he used to be.</p><p>so while he hasn't gained any weight, i'm betting his body fat percentage is higher -- so he's kind of skinny/fat if that makes any sense.</p><p>unfortunately, all of these meds are a guessing game.</p><p>there's not much for the dr to do but say let's try the next one on the list and hope you eventually get to the right one.</p><p>if it makes you feel any better, i'm not on any prescription meds and i'm having a hard time losing weight myself.</p><p>i don't have anything to blame it on but myself.</p>
