IS it the Dopamine?</div></blockquote><p>Hi Annaone,</p><p>Heres what I have read, there are three phases; Lust, Attraction and Attachment.</p><p><strong><span style="color:#FF0000;">Lust</span></strong> is driven by testosterone and estrogen. Testosterone also plays a big part in female sexuality. A researcher described this phase as "being out looking for anything." LOL</p><p><strong><span style="color:#FF00FF;">Attraction</span></strong> is where the neurotransmitters we are know so well in MH circles. High levels of dopamine and norepinepherine and low levels of serotonin. This phase I think is what you are talking about, dopamine for pleasure feelings, norepinepherine for the jacked up feeling, loss of appetite, reduced need for sleep and wanting nothing more than daydreaming about our new mates. I got a kick out the description attached to serotonin, it being the most important and the one most likely to set us temporarily insane!!!! <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p><p>The last phase is <strong><span style="color:#800080;">Attachment</span></strong> and it is a longer acting phase, that of wanting to have babies together. This is mediated by oxytocin and vasopressin. Oxytocin is the normal hormone of child birth and lactation, but it is also secreted by both sexes during orgasm. So the theory is that the more sex, the stronger the long term commitment. Vasopression is elevated as well during long term commitment and regulates the kidney. I don't know either, but experiments on animals given a drug that inhibited its production caused the male to lose interest in the female and/or fail to protect the female from other suiters.</p><p>Here are some interesting relationships between these chemicals, you can draw you own conclusions. </p><p>High levels of oxytocin or vasopressin cause dopamine and norepinepherine levels to fall. High levels of testosterone cause oxytocin and vasopressin level to fall. When a male holds a child infant, his testosterone levels fall. And lastly, <strong>high serotonin levels suppress the Attraction phase and may explain why SSRIs sometimes leaves one with ambiguous feelings of not being "in love like before". </strong>Well, have a field day with all those goodies, I am sure this topic will get a lot of play and various opinions as well.</p><p>BE Peace and BE Love....  wayne</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Interesting, Wayne.  So you would think that l[low serotonin levels would increase the Attraction phase and make you feel more in love than ever before, which should make you feel good, but instead you are depressed.  Maybe youre thinking oh jeeze here we go again the falling in love thing only to have it fizzle out later, blah, Im depressed. Lol</p><p>GS</p>
