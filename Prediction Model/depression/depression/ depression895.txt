I cannot take SSRI and SNRI type meds, Lexapro and Effexor once tytrated up on kick in seizures and don't seem to like me. I am looking for what people use in long term use, no benzo drugs as I do not trust those and want to depend on them with their known affects on what they can do to your body. Any help would be super appreciated before I head to the doc, any help will definitely help! Thanks everyone-<p>-Tyler</p></div></blockquote><p>What about MAOIs or Tri-cyclic ADs?</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>Anyone to put me in the direction of doing research or links on those? my doctor is going to keep me on the process of the Neurontin, and going towards 300mg/ 3 times daily. I guess really works well as a mood stabilizer and just keep things smooth. I really need that badly now, now knowing I have brain damage at age 22 from SSRI use most likely, I need all the help I can get overcoming this : /</p>
