<p>I am bipolar and have been on Lithium exclusively for 5+ years. I tend to have long periods of stability, however I have found that external stress events....like a dealth or breakup, can hit me pretty hard. In the past my "events" were always manic, recently a death and break-up within 4 months of each other sent me into a primordial funk. It has taken 3+ months to get stable. This ain't no fun....</p>
