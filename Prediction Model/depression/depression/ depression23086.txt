I think my mother was depressed but back then no-one really talked about depression and mental health issues like today. My mother died at age 50 when i was 27 from cancer but i think i had been depressed long before that. I moved out of my parents house when i was 19 to move into my now husbands home..i was never able to really live and be young..had children by age 21 and we lived out of state and had no relatives and i had no friends there so I was pretty much stuck at home to care for my children and we never went out because we never had a sitter.  <p>But recently my depression has been worsening..my sister died of lung cancer 2 years ago..i think thats when things really began the downward spiral..also my oldest daughter graduated high school and moved to texas to be with her fiance..and now she is expecting a baby at the end of Oct!! so I will be a grandmother at age 41 or maybe 42 depending on when the baby comes.. so yeah theres alot of factors leading up to my depression..I should be happy for my daughter and I am..its just alot of stuff to take in and I see her taking the same path I did at her age and I really dont want that for her but if she is happy then sobeit...</p></div></blockquote><p>(((Kel))), that sounds like my story.  Married at 18, baby at 19, 21 and 28.  All those young, pretty, sweet, innocent years holed up in the boonies!!!  It was hard when my children left home.  You feel so abandoned, but it is what they are supposed to do. So sorry to hear of your mother and sister, that is a big blow!!!  We have to remember that  Birdies well fed and taken care of are supposed to leave the nest; just like we did.   Daughters, tho do tend to stay closer than sons.  There is a saying a son marries a woman, you lose a son, a daughter marries a man, you gain a son-inlaw!!!   If that helps.  GS</p>
