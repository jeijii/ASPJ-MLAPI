<p>I would definitely recommend ECT, but after you have tried a good amount of other options.  I had many suicide attempts and hospitalizations before they let me try ECT (though I'd been begging the doctors for years).  So I started having ECT 2 years ago, when I was 16.  </p><p>I started with probably 16 treatments (outpatient, 3x/week).  Initially I had unilateral, then switched to bilateral (which has more side effects but is more powerful).  I found the effects to be amazing.  For the first time in probably 5 years, I was not extremely suicidal.  What I have done basically is have ECT as needed.  When I start getting suicidal again or self-injuring (basically I get 3 months before I need ECT) I get usually about 9 more treatments.  That's been going on for the past 2 years.  My memory and concentration have definitely been affected.  I take alzheimers meds (off-label) to try to help.  But, its the only treatment that has even helped a little bit.  I still take tons of meds every day (lithium, seroquel, lamictal, xanax, synthroid, aricept) but I don't really know if they actually do anything.</p><p> And on a side note, about a year ago, I found a study that showed using ketamine for the anaestesia with ECT made it more effective.  So I've been doing that for the past year or so.  My family thinks it helped some.  And they definitely think the ECT has made the biggest difference of any treatment I've received.  I have had a few suicide attempts in the past 2 years, but I've been doing a lot better over all.  </p><p>It is expensive, even with insurance.  I don't know the details because I'm still under my parents insurance.  But I hope you find treatment that works.  I just had ECT again in December/January, so if you have any questions I will try to help.</p>
