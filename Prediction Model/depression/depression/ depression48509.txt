I did that when I had no insurance and no meds, and it helped somewhat. The l-tyrosine gives some energy and focus, and the 5-HTP is calming. I don't take those supplements with antidepressants, because it's too much for me. 5-HTP with SSRIs is actually dangerous. Be careful about how much l-tyrosine you take with WB, because too much can make you anxious and irritable, and raise your blood pressure. 500 mgs in the morning should be plenty if you're also taking WB. Some people who don't take ADs take 1,000 or 2,000 mgs, 1-3 times a day. I find that eating well and getting enough quality protein gives me plenty of l-tyrosine. BTW, I take 300 mgs WB XL.</div></blockquote><p>And I was just about to try 5-HTP along with my 60Mg of Cymbalta!!!</p><p>I guess its not a good idea then?</p><p>I thought they did a study in the 70s/80s using both Prozac and 5-HTP together?</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p><span style="color:#008000;">Hi Psychocandy,</span></p><p><span style="color:#008000;">In the book I was reading that I mentioned earlier, they don't recommend taking 5-htp or an amino acid (like L-Tyrosine) if you are taking an SSRI, and always consult with your doctor. </span></p>
