<p>For many years I was on a moderate to low dose of Lexapro for mid-grade depression and anxiety. But it was causing sexual side-effects and drowsiness problems, and also seemed to be generally losing its effectiveness. So over the last two years I've tried a couple of different medications, none of which have really worked well for me.</p><p>Most recently I started on Cymbalta. It seemed to be working pretty well most of the time -- except in the mornings. Every morning I'd wake up in a frothing panic, worrying about random things. I'd see something that would remind me of something else and get a stab of anxiety. I was sad and weepy and didn't feel like doing anything for several hours. It would start to clear up by late morning and by mid-afternoon, the same things that drove me into a panic in the morning would just roll off my back.</p><p>I started thinking about this and wondering if there might be a scientific explanation for it. I've been taking melatonin to help me get to sleep for a long time, and about a month or two ago started also taking non-prescription benadryl for allergy and sleep aid reasons. My doctor is aware of these. My research hasn't indicated that there's any known drug interaction between either and Cymbalta -- though some have hypothesized that melatonin could have an interaction with SSRIs.</p><p>Regardless, I felt it was a worthwhile experiment to stop taking the melatonin and the allergy medication.</p><p>Anyway, the results were remarkable. I did have a harder time falling and staying asleep. Yet despite that, the difference has been night and day in how I feel in the morning. I still feel some anxiety, but much less than before. And instead of being sad and crying, I feel energetic and like getting things done.</p><p>Note that I am not suggesting making changes to your <em>prescription</em> medications without consulting your doctor. And some folks might not want to even change their non-prescription meds without a physician's advice.</p><p>But the moral of the story is that there's still a lot we don't understand about how SSRIs and similar medications work, and also how they interact with other things. Also, that everyone is unique and our reactions to medications can be unique as well.</p><p>If you suspect that there's a pattern to when you feel worse off, it might be worth asking your doctor about making changes to see if they will help.</p>
