<p>How can I tell if its the right one for me and that it is not putting myself at danger any more than an antidepressant or alcohol would?</p><p>If it brings me complete happiness and relief, sort of like a dream come true, because I am finally, miraculously healed, does that mean that this medicine is the right one for me?</p><p>If I take a certain medication that is not prescribed for a certain reason, but for an entirely different reason, does that make it wrong?</p><p>I am not taking more than the prescribed dosage and certainly have been recording any experiences that I have had.</p><p>Basically, lets use this as an example. If one was to take advil for depression and anxiety and was cured by it, should they take advil for the rest of their life, or what?</p><p>People do use other things such as alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs as a crutch for depression, but none of those are as effective as this would be for me. This may not be the same for others.</p><p>I have told several doctors and several pharmacists and my counselor what I have been doing to relieve my depression. I have tried about nine or ten different types of antidepressants over the course of 5 years, and this has helped more than any drug, legal or illegal. The doctors have said that I should be fine, but its been two months, and I need someone to talk to about this. I need someone to talk to about my depression. I can't stand having to wait two months in between appointments.</p><p>I guess I am just waiting for someone to counsel me or something... I don't know, but I need help. Bad.</p>
