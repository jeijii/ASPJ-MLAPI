<p>Thanks for your help. You have made me see things a little differently. </p><p>How would my pdoc even know what kind of depression I have without some specific scientific test? </p><p>Is there some type of test the pdoc could do to figure out if it is pyshcological, social, situational, etc? Or is it just a judgment call on the part of the pdoc and myself?</p><p>I am just frustrated because I want to get better quickly and don't want to rely on meds if I have to. Pdoc put me on wellbutrin (about 16days) and lexapro (8days)....</p><p>I was on wellbutrin for many years and just recently got off of it about 8 months ago and was feeling the best I have ever felt! But in the last few weeks I have gone down hill for no </p><p>aparrant reason. I thought that being off the AD's for 8 months meant I would never see or feel this depression again....I am ashamed and even depresses that I have resorted to these meds. Feel like a drugged out zombie right now with no feeling, emotion, ect... I do feel deep down inside I need to get off the meds again and see how I feel, because the way I am now is no way to live. (i.e., sleepless nights, zombie, not thinking clearly, ect) And it might get worse if I get off them.... but then at least I will have learned something about myself and then go back on them. </p><p>I have a pdoc appt monday so I will see...... I feel the doctors really don't know what they are doing or how to prescribe (but maybe I have not found the right pdoc) </p><p>sincerely, rt</p><blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentcommentid="589192" data-ipsquote-username="whoiam" data-cite="whoiam" data-ipsquote-contentapp="forums" data-ipsquote-contenttype="forums" data-ipsquote-contentid="40847" data-ipsquote-contentclass="forums_Topic"><div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">rtp69,</span><p><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">"I know everyone talks about a "chemical imbalance" and all the other scientific stuff..."  </span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">I think it would help you to look into the type of depression you might have: chemical imbalance (several types), physcological, social, situational, etc. so that you will understand what the "scientific stuff" is and why in some cases medication is necessary. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">Not everyone needs meds, or will need them for life.  Medications for depression are no different than for someone with diabetes...how much they take and for how long depends on what their body can produce on it's own and if it needs help.  Type one diabetics usually respond well to diet and exercise and don't need medication where a type III diabetic will still need insulin regardless of what he changes.  In either case while a positive attitude is very important, to expect a diabetic to "think" himself out of his disease is not realistic.  Depression is no different.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">Certainly one should use whatever means are at their disposal to live a healthy lifestyle.  </span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">Don't be too hard on yourself if you have to rely on medications, be thankful that something will relieve the symptoms.  Give yourself time for the medications to work...some take up to 6 weeks or more to give their full effect.  </span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">We are all waiting for the day to come when we no longer have to suffer any kind of illness.  Be hopeful, be smart and be safe.</span></p></div></blockquote>
