<p>My depression was started by stopping one of my epilepsy meds. I was on Depakote for 15 years, my nureologist took me off Depakote. When my DR. did this I developed a chemical balance. I am now on prestiq. I still cry when I get frustrated, and there are times when I don't want to talk to people. But life is much better. <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p>
