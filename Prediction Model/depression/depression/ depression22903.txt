<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I watched a very interesting episode of Democracy Now! today about how important the very early stages of development are to our mental well-being as well as our tendencies to addiction and depression later in life. The modern world of Capitalism that we live in now has all but destroyed our personal connections we have with each other, and it is causing the incidences of ADHD, depression and addiction to skyrocket, not to mention cancer and other stress-related diseases. PM for more information.</p><p>-S Frye</p>
