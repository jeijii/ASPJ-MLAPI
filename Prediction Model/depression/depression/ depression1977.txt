I asked if I could read it or see a copy, and she won't show me. She told me basically what was in it, but won't show me. I rang work, they said they have to get her permission for me to read my own report. They are going to contact her. I think I will have to apply through Freedom of Information. I rang the union and they haven't returned my call.</div></blockquote><p>crashandburn-</p><p>Something here is just not right.  First, I'd like to ask if you signed a release form for her to provide this information to your employer.  If not, the she's probably covering her behind, and shooting you a smokescreen to cover this up.  You do have a right t YOUR medical records(all of them), and I stress <strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">YOUR</span></em></strong> medical records.  Perhaps you signed something from the company that restricted the information she could provide, and to whom(?).</p><p>Pdocs and tdocs are not accustomed to patients rights to empowerment and self advocacy.  It makes them cringe.  If I were in your shoes, I'd march right into the psych's office and DEMAND a copy that is  stamped, signed "Clients Copy", "Confidential".  To my knowledge, that cannot be denied.  When I hear of things like this it makes my blood boil.</p><p>Perheps this psych has a bit too cozy relationship with the company you work for.....unethical to say the least and likely breaches something covered under HIPPA.</p><p>Fully investigate this!</p><p>Warmenst Regards,</p><p>Deepster</p>
