Something to ask my doctor.<p>On with the weirdness--every time I turn on the bathroom fan, the air conditioner, the dishwasher, even the shower, I hear voices, and it is scaring me. They don't talk to me, and many times I hear music. It has me concerned--am I freaking out? Last weekend I heard the theme song from <em>Rocky</em> which was interrupted by men calling a baseball game. I couldn't understan what they were saying though. At least that rules out my fillings picking up a radio staion--there is no baseball to broadcst this time of year</p><p>Does anyone have experiece with auditory hallucination--related to Wellbutrin or anything else?</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p></div></blockquote><p>Hey. I know before I started my meds (Effexor, now Lexapro), I was sure my apartment was haunted, because I thought I heard a man whispering in my ear. I never associated it with static noise (fans, water running, etc.). One time the man said "Boo"... it was just like his lips were right next to my ear. Thank goodness that doesn't happen anymore. </p><p>See if you can check out the film "White Noise"... it'll totally freak you out.</p><p>Anyway, I know someone who had out of body experiences on Wellbutrin, which falls in the family of sensory hallucinations.</p><p>I'd tell you to ask your doctor, but they may prematurely label you schitzophrenic.</p><p>Hugs and keep us posted!</p>
