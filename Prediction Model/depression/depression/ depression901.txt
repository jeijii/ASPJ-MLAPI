<p><span style="color:#ff00ff;">loonatik </span>- so sorry for the pressures and disappointments - please try to be patient w/ yourself and keep your head up. i'm in US, making only slightly more than you, sole income for bf and i, no kids (and no, a child wouldn't be an option financially even if i DID want one!).  i know it is SO frustrating to be held back from things you want to do just b/c of money; i hate it too.  (i feel like i could be doing so much more good in the world, or at least my community, w/o having to worry so much about ends meeting all the time.)  it is going to be very rough for you and your husband for a while, but LOTS of people are in the same boat right now, having lost everything or close to it. there are lots of articles lately talking about ways to save money and how to even improve marriages/relationships by having to only do "cheap dates" etc. .....at least here in glutinous US, those articles never were so popular, but now that so many have lost so much, there are tons!</p><p><span style="color:#4b0082;">nealy</span> - "Like, I will tell them I have 0$ and then they say... "so how much can you pay today?"  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"> lol What I like to do .... is just shred the bills I get and then they don't exist anymore for awhile  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_flowers.gif" alt=":flowers:"> "</p><p>...........Sometimes that's all you can do at the moment!!  I have that reaction to a lot of stuff (especially $ woes, when I've done everything I can and still worrying); I call it the "stealth turtle reaction."  :)</p>
