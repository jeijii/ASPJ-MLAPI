<p>moiraine:  *grumbles*  You hit everything on the spot.  Insurance here really does suck.  For example, I've been looking at tons of health plans (I unfortunatly can't get on the group health plan at work because they refuse to hire anyone "full time", don't get me started on that either!) and I'd say about 75% of them didn't even cover mental health in any way.  Why is that?!?!  It shouldn't be treated differently than any other illness.  Grrrr...and I've heard from several, when I inquired about mental health coverage, that if you are bi-polar, most companies won't cover you at all, regardless of the preexisting condition.   What is wrong with the world?  Why is mental health treated so differently than physical health?  It's like if I get ulcers from being anxious and having panic attacks all the time, the system will help me treat the ulcers, but not the panic attacks!  And if they helped with the panic attacks, that would cure both of the problems...</p><p>Well I think I might have found one place....its called Assurant health if anyone is curious.  They have a pre-existing condition thing just like all the other places, but they are more lenient about it.  I told them that I have depression, see a psychiatrist, and am on medication, and they said they will cover it, it just costs a little more per month.  Not too expensive tho...I do have a $2,500 deductible tho.  =(  And a $500 deductible for name brand prescriptions which is why I"M hoping I can get samples until next year because I don't think a generic form of cymbalta will be out until then and I know its crazy expensive!</p>
