Dr put me on 7.5mg Zopiclone along with 20mg Citalopram.  I thought I was doing great getting 4 hrs uninterupted sleep!!   <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_flowers.gif" alt=":flowers:">  So she increased my Zopiclone to 15 mg, increased my Citalopram to 60mg, and eventually added Trazodone 50mg.  Last visit, she increased the Trazodone to 150mg and added 150mg Wellbutrin in the day time.  I am in the process of having my medical file transfered to the city, and the doctor that will be taking over my file said that I could take 150mg more of the Wellbutrin, move taking the Citalopram before bed to mornings, as for some people it causes alertness, and she eventually wants to take me off the Zopiclone all together.  So, I have been trying to take the Citalopram in the morning for the last two mornings.  I have been so zoned out, nausiated, unsteady on my feet (just to name a few things I have been feeling through the day), and only got 3 1/2 hrs of broken sleep last night.  Taking the Citalopram before bed, and increasing the Trazodone to 150mg helped me to get 6 hrs sleep, with only waking up once, looked at the clock and went right back to sleep.  Best sleep I have had in months!!  I am thinking that I will move taking the Citalopram back to before bed, because I <span style="text-decoration:underline;">need</span> the sleep and I <span style="text-decoration:underline;">don't</span> need to feel this aweful through the day.</p><p>Hugs ~ Angel  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p>
