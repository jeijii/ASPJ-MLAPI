<p>I had to stop taking cymbalta 5 weeks ago due to abnormal liver funtion, I was taking it for depression and anxiety. Have tried a whole list of other things too. The last couple of weeks or so I think I have had trouble with my breathing. I am really aware of it sometimes and it seems an effort to breathe, as if I have to make an effort or I will stop, I sound crazy!!!! Can also feel my heart beating in the top of my chest and neck, and also getting palpitations regularly. Have to force myself to think of other things till the episode passes so it doesn't keep building up. I hate feeling like this  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:">  Determined not to go back on medication but worried it will keep building up. Had my first reki session today, hoping it will help-does anyone know how often I should have it done? I am booked in again for next Friday.</p>
