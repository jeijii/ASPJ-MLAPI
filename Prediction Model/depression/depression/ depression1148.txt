Zinc and Selenium are very good for auto immune diseases. I have Lupus, which is an auto immune disease, but on a different scale, instead of my immune system being weak, my immune system is too strong and my white blood cell count is too high. So my immune system attacks my body. If I take Zinc, selenium or any other immune booster, I end up with a horrid lupus flare, like I did a few weeks back.</p><p>I had the flu and took some flu medicine without checking it (naughty me) and I ended up very ill with a kidney infection. It was an immune booster. </p><p>You have to be so careful with supplements and meds. </p><p>Trace</p></div></blockquote><p>Hi Trace, sorry to hear you have Lupus and are unable to take zinc. I used to know a lady that had Lupus, she was on Prozac for mood, not sure if she had a zinc intolerence. Guess you'll have to eat a few more oysters to get your daily-ration ! <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_shocked.gif" alt=":shocked:"></p>
