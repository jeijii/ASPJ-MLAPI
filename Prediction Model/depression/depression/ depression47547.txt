<p>Hi PoeticProse, thank you for your response &amp; the info, it is very helpful.  I guess I didn't fully understand how it worked.  I knew about it helping the cravings but not that it countered the effects of the alcohol.  I haven't drank since I have been on it but it really does help with the cravings.  I am looking for long term recovery however, and it sounds like AA or another support group will be my best bet in the long term.  As reluctant as I am, I will likely seek out more AA meetings.  Thanks again for the info.</p>
