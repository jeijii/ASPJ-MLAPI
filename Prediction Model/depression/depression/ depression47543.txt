I'm a creative, sensitive type, and I was afraid all of that would be squashed if I went on antidepressants. I think it's very common and understandable that people fear their unique personality will "die". The answer I have for you is not entirely clear. There's no doubt that antidepressants change you, when they work. That's the whole point. But I don't feel that they have changed my core being. What they've done is change qualities of my personality that needed repair. You might say some of my darker aspects have atrophied while some brighter and stronger qualities have strengthened and come forward. So it's still me, just a more positive version of me. I still get upset, still have my concerns and passions, but I'm no longer paralyzed with depression. In fact, now that I'm in remission, I would say that depression is the force that alters and mutilates your personality,  and antidepressants help to free you from that, so you can heal and regain your true self. Psychotherapy is also a big help, and that paired with medication is a very powerful combination. You have nothing to lose (and a whole lot to gain) by giving medication a try for a couple of months to see what it can do for you. It won't alter you permanently, and I say that from experience. I've gone off medication a couple of times, and slowly returned to my former, dark self. It's been very enlightening to go back and forth, and really feel the difference firsthand. I suppose it's true that some things die off with antidepressants, but it's generally the things that would have you die. It's hard for me to explain this accurately, just as it's hard for you to get your point across, as you said. The only way you can really know what it's like is to give it a try.</span></p>
