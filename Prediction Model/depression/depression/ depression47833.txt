<p><span style="font-size:12px;">I just wanted to share this with those of you that are needing to stop smoking, want to stop, or just tired of smelling like a walking ashtray.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:Verdana, Tahoma, Arial;">The traditional E-Cig has three parts that when assembled are similar in size to a traditional cigarette (some models are the exact same size) and are very simple to operate. A rechargeable battery is screwed into an atomizer. Then you connect a "filter" (cartridge) that contains e-liquid . When you inhale on the cartridge / filter, the atomizer heats the liquid into a vapor that mimics cigarette smoke with regard to taste and warmth.</span></span></span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><strong>I just bought myself a disposable e-cig from the cornor store. I would recommend doing so to see if its for you. Although a lil pricey $10.91 with tax, these ingrediients compared to regular cigs. I'm game! </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><strong>Electric Cigarette Ingredient: Nicotine 1.6 per mil 100% derived from tobacco plants. </strong></span></p><p></p><p><strong><strong><span style="font-family:Verdana, Tahoma, Arial;">Cigarette Smoke is a toxic cocktail of over </span></strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><strong><span style="font-family:Verdana, Tahoma, Arial;">4000 chemicals.</span></strong></strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="color:#000080;">Artificial and natural flavoring is mixed to produce a variety of flavors.</span></span></span></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="color:#000080;"> E-liquids are offered with several levels of nicotine (High, Medium, Low),</span></span></span></span></strong></span> <strong>some contain no nicotine.</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You should only consider using an Electronic Cigarette as a recreational product if you currently use traditional tobacco cigarettes.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I can sit here and honestly tell you that in 48 hrs I had only smoked 10 real cigarettes. I usually smoke 1/2 pack to a pack a day. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">it's pricey to start but in the long run it's cheaper, healthier, and dont have the 4,000 other chemicals </span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I can pm you a few sites that are really helpful with explanations and what to choose and they have youtube vids explaining it all and one of them is a doctor!!!</span></span></p><p></p>
