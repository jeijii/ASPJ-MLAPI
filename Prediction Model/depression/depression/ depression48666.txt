<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I am relatively new to this site, but not new to depression.  I have been battling what I suspected to be depression for the last 10 years on and off, I tried Sam-e and St. John's Wort, to no avail (the sjw made me extremely ill, and on the sam-e, I went into several panic attacks).  I had been resisting going to therapy, based on the fact that my mother had borderline personality disorder, and quite frankly I was terrified that they would tell me that I had it too.  4 months ago, however, I hit the lowest low I have ever felt, and sought help by starting my therapy journey.  I have since been diagnosed with depression, and GAD.  It was a relief to know that I do not have BPD, but a diagnosis was still scary, nonetheless.  After a month or two of CBT, my therapist suggested that I could greatly benefit from anti-depressants.  I have always been apprehensive, and asked if there was something natural that I could take, before agreeing to go with pharmaceuticals.  My therapist suggested 5-htp (she suspected that my serotonin levels were extremely low).</p><p>I started taking 50mg of 5-htp 30 mins before bed, and 50mg mid morning (12 hour spacing, or 100mg in a 24 hour period) and in just 1 week I am feeling such relief.  I haven't felt this upbeat, and stress free in years!!  It has also had a huge impact on my sleeping patterns, I now fall asleep quickly, and sleep all the way through the night without an issue, and when I wake up, I am wide awake and ready to go (very very different from my dragging out of bed and 3 cups of coffee just to be able to speak to anyone).  I have experienced absolutely no side effects at all, which is a bonus.</p><p>Anyway, I just wanted to share this info.  I am so excited, and I truly believe that this medication, plus therapy has saved my life :)</p><p>Ley x</p>
