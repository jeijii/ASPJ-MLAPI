I used to feel flat, emotionless and gained30 lbs to boot,  but this particular drug made me feel content.  Only I was content to do nothing.  So for 8 years, I contendedly moved along life, just observing, not partiipating and the worst thing was... that was fine with me.</p><p>Finally I decided to go off it.  I did, gradually and all of a sudden, I had a personality, feelings, emotions - good and bad.  I was normal.  I did have to keep taking my Paxil though but that was fine with me.</p><p>I often think of those 8 totally non-productive years that slipped by me in a daze. I never got upset, mad or nervous.  People used to say I had the most soothing voice.  It was hard for me to recognize that I wasnt me because I was fine with it.  I called myself the armchair person.  I would watch travel shows in my armchair, rather than care about actually going.</p><p>So, yes try something else, tell your doc.  The new anti-depressants out now are so much better, but you have to have patience, we all have different experiences on the same drug.  Just dont give up, its worth being a guinea pig for awhile.</p><p>Best Wishes and Hope the Lamictol works good for you Lucinda.  My friend takes it and loves it!!!</p><p>Gentle Sun    <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_shocked.gif" alt=":shocked:"><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_bump.gif" alt=":bump:"><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p></div></blockquote><p>This discription fits me perfect and I'm glad you've posted. I will recomemnd changing or doing something different. I definatly don't want to waste years off my life, already 3 have gone.</p><p> Thank you</p>
