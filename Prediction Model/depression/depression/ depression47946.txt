<p>I have read several books on depression.  I would have to agree that while I read them, it gives me a positive lift.  So in that way, they are good.  Maybe we should read one after the other- heehee.  </p><p>The best self-help books I have read which actually stayed with me are:  </p><p><strong>Co-dependent No More </strong>- Melody Beattie ( a saying in this book I have taken with me thru life)</p><p><strong>Language of Letting Go</strong> - Melody Beattie - This became a bible to me.  It is worn and water stained (from reading in the tub) and bent, but it is probably the best book ever on anxiety, depression, anger, fear, etc.  It is written by days.  Each day deals with an issue and relates to how you feel, then gives you good insight and things to remember to get your thinking back on track.  Whats good is if you are dealing with anger, you can go to the index and find anger, which day it is and go to that page so you dont have to read it in order, day by day.</p><p><strong>Life 101 </strong>- John Rogers and Peter McWilliams - Very good</p><p><strong>Living, Loving and Learning </strong>- Leo Buscaglia - Great read</p><p>Gentle Sun</p>
