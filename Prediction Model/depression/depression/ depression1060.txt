I know I have a problem with starting tasks because I necessarily don't feel motivated to do them at the time.  However, the one time I did get myself to do something today is when I just made myself do it - which is hard to describe, I know.  I didn't feel motivated to do it at the time, but once I started going I found myself becoming more motivated to finish.</p><p>Second: "Break down tasks into small, achievable chunks.  If you focus on the entire project at once, you probably won't feel like starting."</p><p>Hopefully that helps a bit.</p></div></blockquote><p>Hiya alovelydissenter! Thanks for replying!</p><p>"Depression for Dummies"? Hmm, I will look at into that. The second quote definitely rings a bell, because usually I plan on cleaning the whole house at once because everything is always messy at the same time. So then I may get 1 or 2 things done like the dishes and sweeping. Then I get lazy. It feels good to get that little task done but then everything else is still messy and then by the time I get to that, my kitchen is messy again, lol! It's a never ending cycle! AHHH! Anyway, thanks for the advice, I am going to look into that book for sure.</p><p>Have a good one!</p><p> <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"> Nealy</p>
