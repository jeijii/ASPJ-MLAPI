<p>I do this often, at least once weekly. I either say or do something, then realize it was something that I should not have done or said. I then get very upset and anxiety because I want to change it. Then I feel a bit depersonalized and tense mainly in my back. Today I'm beating myself over mocking/laughing about something my mom said. I was laughing about this to my daughter. Then right afterwards felt extremely horrible and immature. I did say toy daughter (11 yrs old) that I shouldn't have made fun of my mom and that it wasn't nice. Then she still laughed about it a bit more. We were laughing about how my mother exploded at me with her temper last week. I really don't know what's wrong with me... I have not been able to find a good therapist and psychiatrist. But  thinking ADD and anxiety... Or something more. Please help!!! Thanks! </p>
