<p>Wow, I have a great support system from my parents, and I'm depressed. The ability of everyone to keep battling depression while having circumstances, dependents, etc, it amazes me. I have circumstances other people would **** to have, and I'm depressed. Sometimes this makes me feel guilty, though. I am really sleepy so I should probably get some rest. I'm not sure I'm making sense anyway. I think I have the flu.</p>
