<p>Hello, I am newbie, not a doctor or a professional, but I *totally* agree as always with Jim Bow who knows his stuff.  *personally* I think natural depressants are not the way to go and I stick them away in the nonsense file.  You say your mother has been experiencing some terrible side effects.  You didnt mention which, but alas, most all anti-depressants can have some bad side-effects *initially* - The thing is, they *do* go away with time.  Its very hard to start or stop a certain anti-depressant.  My Paxil has failed me and I am going through some pretty bad side-effects while my body is getting use to the new anti-depressant which is probably also causing me some initial start up side effects.  </p><p>I dont know how long your mother stayed with one of the fore-mentioned drugs.  Perhaps she gave up to fast!  It can take weeks and weeks before suddenly you wake up one day just feeling *super* its like a hump you have to get over.  Then you are home free.  Please see your doctor who has prescribed these medications - some doctors dont realize how long it takes for a person to get use to them!  There are good doctors and no so good doctors, perhaps you should take her to see a psychiatrist!  They are the *experts* in precribing drugs and informing you of what side-effects you can have, and providing medications to help even eleviate those initial side effects.  My psychiatrist fore-warned me of what I was going to have to go through abandoning paxil and he gave me medications to deal with insomnia, and even a drug to help eleviate the side effects of paxil withdrawal (yah, they even have a medication to help people withdraw from paxil as the withdrawal symptoms are terrible!! but paxil did work for me like 15 years or so.  Sometimes after many years, an anti-depressant just gives out and you have to switch to another.</p><p>Anyway, my recommendation is to see a second doctor or more importantly a psychiatrist who deals extensively with prescribing anti-depressants and I am thinking that just possibly your mother abandoned one of the drugs too soon.  It is easy for some people to start one of the drugs and very difficult for others.</p><p>Good Luck and please dont use any of those natural anti-depressants, I think they are frauds, stay with a doctor even get a second opinion- whats to hurt??</p>
