<p>I have come to suspect that with me it is a serotonin thing. I tried Wellbutrin for over 9 weeks and it seemed to work in some ways but my irritability came back and there were still ups and downs. I started Lexapro (SSRI) just a few days ago and responded immediately! I also found out recently that SSRIs do not make you produce more serotonin, they just cause your neurons to soak up more in the serotonin you already produce. I was also on Zoloft and Prozac years back and (Zoloft especially) worked pretty well.  </p><p>I've always felt different too and actually, like an alien as well! When you say ignorance is bliss, I can relate because I was really tired of sitting and thinking of all this stuff and the AD I am on now has taken all that away. I WANTED to stop thinking and worrying and feeling anxious, etc. So far, it's helped, and the quick positive reaction has indicated to me that this type of med works for my "type." </p><p>I think the SSRIs are a good first stop to trying and finding a right med. A lot of people don't like the sexual side effects or weight gain/loss, but to me, it is worth it to have peace of mind.</p>
