<p>This is "new" not actually new. Mindfulness meditation is an excellent discipline if you suffer depression. Kabat Zinn has a series of videos about stress on youtube -- those are worth checking out. There is LOTS of stuff on this on the web -- check out wildmind, too, the blog section has a recent article.</p><p>Depression is closely linked to anxiety, and meditation is a useful antidote to anxiety. It also increases your ability to concentrate and lifts your mood. Over time, it will actually change your brain -- it's like exercise for the neurons -- and help you work on your ruminations, so you wind up thinking less obsessively.</p><p>What's new is that MBCT has now got some good research supporting it.</p>
