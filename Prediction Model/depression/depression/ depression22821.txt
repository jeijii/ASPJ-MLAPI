<p>I have often wondered about acupuncture also. I have a friend who goes to relieve stress and just loves it. From what I know of it, sounds like a good thing to try out for sure. Btw, I read that while pinching the upper part of the ear it will help cravings of addiction to be cut off. So if that works, we could find some do at home acupuncture-like methods. :P half kidding.  </p><p>I just began taking a bunch of natural supplements which are said to help with all sorts of things such as stress reduction, brain functions like memory, concentration, etc, one supports serotonin synthesis.... but I agree with Cinnamona, these are no substitute for the medications prescribed for various mental illnesses. For instance, if I have Bipolar, which it seems I do, I need a mood stabilizer like Lithium at least. </p><p>Hope you find whatever works for you.</p>
