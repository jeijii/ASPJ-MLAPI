<p>Hello</p><p>Your right, with the advent of nodern meds ECT went out of fassion but never realy went away. One of the hospitals around has opened a clinic devoted to ECT and I went to another just devoted to ECT. I think those doing ECT is on the rise as doctors realise that there are still some people that meds just don;t do it for. Having ECT as an outpatent is like this. You  put on a gown are taken into a fulley equiped and staffed OR type room and lay down on a bed,  You breath oxygen through a mask and then injeceted with a short acting anathysia. Good night. You wake up 15 minets later you wake up in a recovery room with no memmory of the procedure. 20 minets after that you are out the door. No trauma. Yes you might be confused but you are not a drooling *****. At any time you are free to say no more treatments. I have tried to find holes in my memmory but cant. I still remembered all my passeords and the names and numbers inportent in my life. You can still be on your meds whilr you do ECT. I was taking NARDIL and had no problems. What I am trying to say here is don't be afraid to try ECT if offered or let your Doc that you are willing when the time comes in your treatment.</p><p>Hope you have a good tomaruw</p><p>Bigd</p>
