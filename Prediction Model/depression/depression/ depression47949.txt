<p>Ok this is still driving me nuts. I feel like it shows up my internal chaos. </p><p> </p><p>I have now watched all the youtube conscious tv episodes twice each. In fact a couple of them I have watched 3 times! And read up again.</p><p> </p><p>When I do tests I come up as the same score for around 4 or 5 of them usually. I am trying to look back and think how I was before because I have undergone a lot of growth and am hugely healthier than I was before. Different actually. Some things look like they fit until I look at the core drivers or motivations or other core aspects of the type, </p><p> </p><p>On that front I identify with type 7s always looking for something new and stimulating. But there is no way I am a 7. I am much too introspective and pleasure absolutely isnt the most important thing for me. Too neurotic too!</p><p>Identify with some of the 9 stuff but I am so not someone unmotivated and undriven. I am good at peace making and I hate conflict but I spend a lot of time thinking and introspecting. </p><p>There could be a 6 ish side of me but although I am safety focused now but its not natural for me. </p><p>I do a lot of 5 and in some ways it would be possible to think I am this type. But I am social at heart and come across as emotional to an extent. Heart still wins over head. I just use head to contain things. </p><p>I am an individualist like a 4 and like to think and do for myself. I am absolutely not someone who has a self pity or special self mentality. I know a 4 and although I know people can come across differently I am so not like her in fundamental ways. </p><p>I have a history of being driven like a 3 but image isnt a core driver for me. And I have always had a much softer side that was apparent.  </p><p>There were a lot of apparent 2 things about me in the past but I never helped people as currency. And I hate people being dependent on me or seeing me as selfless.I am very aware of my faults and foibles and hate manipulation. I speak about things directly. </p><p>I am idealistic like a 1 and a perfectionist but  a lot of the other aspects of this type are a far way off from me. </p><p> </p><p>At a guess I have now whittled the main influences down to 2, 4 and 5 but I am still unsure about 3 and 9. 1 is there but Im not a 1. </p><p>I identify with the types that are separated from body and are in their  heads That loose track of self. Where emotions are intense. </p><p> </p><p>I guess I at least know Im not an 8, 6 or 1!  <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"></p>
