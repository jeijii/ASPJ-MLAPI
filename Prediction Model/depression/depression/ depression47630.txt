<p>Hi rusty1,</p><p>I certainly won't claim to have any answers for you, but I've found that keeping my work life and private life completely separate has worked okay for me. This way, each acts as a reprieve for the other when things aren't going smoothly. To that end, I agree with AngelOfTheMoor about keeping your coworkers away from your depression. Also, finding things that I can enjoy outside of work has helped. My life is much more than my crappy job, if that makes sense, and I see my job as a way to support the things I love- gardening, artwork, etc. I go to work, do my best, keep my head down, and come home. Sounds like an autotron kind of existence, but it's working.</p><p>You sound incredibly insightful about your situation, and I think that bodes well for your finding a solution that works for you. Oh yeah, I bet more sleep would do you some good.</p>
