I didn't want to take medication but eventually accepted that anti-depressant tablets and a beta-blocka make me feel a lot better.  I am able to get out of bed each morning, I can cope with most of the daily tasks and Hubby and I have a life again.

ADs can help someone deal with life in a better way.  If a person feels lighter in mood then the thoughts in their heads go away or they can deal logically with what is happening 'in there'.   A psychotic personality needs a different approach and different medication regimes.  Talking with a doctor will give the sufferer more idea as to what types of 'help' are available.</p><p>Good Luck!</p>
