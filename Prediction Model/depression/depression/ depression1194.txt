<p>Hi Jamie,</p><p>I agree with the rest. Because I take 3 different kinds of pills for blood pressure, there's not much I can take for persistent coughs, and cold miseries. For cold, I use Tylonol and rub my chest down with Vick's Vapour Rub which is very helpful at night for a stuffy nose but my coughs last quite a long time. For the cough I have Gauifenesin w/codeine, and when I had bronchitis earlier this year the accident room dr, wrote me an rx for the tablets (Touro HC). The cough medicine bottle is next to full and I still have many pills left. In the past I took the cough liquid same as you did but I don't bother with it now. Please don't get in the habit of using anything with codeine in it. I found out the hard way it constipates me very badly (think Fleet enema!) and gives me terrible nightmares. If I have no choice with the coughs and I can't sleep I might take a little for the times when I cough so much my ribs ache but soon as I can I get off of it because of the side effects. I take Effexor and I can tell you the side effects get better, just a matter of getting used to a different medicine. I hope the side effects get better real soon <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_bump.gif" alt=":bump:"></p>
