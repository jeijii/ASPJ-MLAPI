<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;">Dear Hellnbak, </span></span></p><p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;">DF helps me to feel better about myself, it helps me work through things faster than I am able to alone. It makes me feel like I am not alone, it makes me laugh. DF makes me feel like I am being of some use to someone else in the world; it comforts and relaxes me. I absolutely love this place, and the sense of community and 'in it together-ness'. Most of all, I love everyone here. </span></span><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p><p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;">Florry </span></span><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_bump.gif" alt=":bump:"></p>
