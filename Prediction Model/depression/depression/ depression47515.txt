	They say that having nothing to prove is a sign of emotional health.  They are lying.  Read autobiographies of any 5 people you respect.  All 5, ALL 5, had something, many things, to prove.  We’re taught to ignore that deep hurt from a long time ago.  But it is your greatest fuel.  Its right there waiting for you.

	And you’ll keep that hurt like a treasure, not telling anyone, writing down with your own hand (not digitally and cheap on some f* **ing deletable screen), tattooing it inside your shoulder where no one will see.

	Every person you respect has it.  And they all tell others ‘I’ve got nothing to prove’ because people with an extra gear greatly frustrate happy couch potatoes.

	You are not happy on the couch, because you know you were made to be more.  Now look at your tattoo and breathe very deeply 10 times, turn off the screen in front of you, look yourself in the eye in the mirror and remember what long ago you knew that you were made to be: An Accomplisher, an Unafraid Champ.  So stop shaking your head … Yes, you know already!  <img alt=":Coopwink:" data-emoticon="" src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_Coopwink.gif" title=":Coopwink:"></p>
