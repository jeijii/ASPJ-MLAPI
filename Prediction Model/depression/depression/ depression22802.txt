<p>Great topic and done very well!!  I too struggle with the weight but am now eating less junk food and am seeing some results!!  Nice too that you mention getting gastric by-pass, etc is nothing to be ashamed of.  Good encouragement for all of us!!! <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p><p>Gentle Sun</p>
