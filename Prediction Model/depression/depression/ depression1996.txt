There are some people who become treatment resistant and they are constantly coming up with news ways to fight and help treat depression. Therapy could help you learn how to cope. Have a look through this room, there are topics on CBT, ECT, vitamins. Also have a look in One Step At A Time. There are some topics in there that can give you assistance with tips on how to cope.</p><p>I hope that you eventually find a med that works and stays working.</p><p>Trace</p></div></blockquote><p>I don't think I can benefit from therapy anymore. I've always been depressed, however, everything around me is for the most part GOOD. I have a parent who cares about me, I'm going to a school with overly nice kids in general, we can afford the things we need and then some... and the 2 sisters I have are fairly outgoing with great social skills. I'm confident in the way I look, and I'm told to be a very attractive guy.</p><p>There is nothing about the life around me that I would change, and there has never been a "reason" for the way I feel. I even know full well that I have a FULL set of social skills with a great a personality just like my sisters but I can't use them.</p><p>I've had very few friends as a child, and in my senior year of HS I have none for the most part. I almost never leave the house except for school in the morning and the few days I go to work. I'm so severely depressed it's completely disabling. I'm in a constant of depression, never wanting to move, talk, listen, or see anybody or anything. This is especially problematic for when I'm working, not only do I haven't an ounce of motivation - my mind is incredibly slowed down and I have trouble thinking and moving at the same time. I'm constantly dropping things and falling behind because of this.</p><p>I can't think of a single thing that makes me happy, and nothing gives me satisfaction. Everyone wants to be rich and have nice things and I'm no different, but I know full well that winning the lotto couldn't make me crack a smile. As a matter of fact, I actually fake smiles in attempt to hide that I'm depressed so that others don't think I hate them. I don't hate anybody, but at the same time I'm unable to enjoy anyone's presence or anything at all.</p><p>I feel like my brain doesn't know how to be happy. Because I never experience happiness or enjoyment, I'd never known I felt different from everyone else until maybe 10 or 11 years old. To be honest, up until I started medication I had never experienced happiness. It was like discovering a new color never seen before.  I was dumbfounded when I realized that smiling happens naturally and I didn't have to fake it anymore. Unfortunately, none of these medications lasted more than a few days before they just stopped working like I said in my first post. I can tell you for a fact that the way I feel each and every day is not worth living. Not being able to enjoy living is one thing, but I feel tortured each and every minute of it. After feeling things like happiness from those few days where medication helped me, I realize WHY life is worth living and my hope is that someday something will let me feel that way again. If I knew for a fact that I would never escape these feelings then I would have no regrets in ending my life, but as long as there is a chance thats always been enough hope for me to continue.</p>
