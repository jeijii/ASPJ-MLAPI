<p>Hi there - I'm new to the forum but have been a frequent visitor for many years.</p><p>I have been on various medications for depression and anxiety since I was 11-- I am 28 now. In the last couple of years I have really focused more on natural healing through supplements and diet/nutirition, but I've been on effexor XR for ~6 years and am down to 75mg.</p><p>I have been struggling with effects of low-serotonin type of depression more so than low dopamine. (I also take adderall xr 5-10 mg a few times a week and love the effects- more social, more drive (dopamine!), more happiness but am aware this is not a long-term solution. It also doesn't work every day.) My depression STRONGLY correlates to hormones and my menstrual cycle- I suspect there's some PMDD going on, too (have been on BC pills before that somewhat helped but am not currently on any).</p><p>Anyway, I came to ask members for advice about <strong>natural supplements to take while still on a low dose of Effexor</strong>. I am looking to get off it at some point. What do you think about adding trytophan to the mix? I take 75mg of effexor xr at bedtime and don't want to trigger serotonin syndrome. I have tried rhodiola rosea before (it's ok) and a few days of 5HTP on during the day (50 mg. it made me feel tired). I am also worried about taking something on days with adderall, if I would need to skip it or adjust the times of dosage? I drink alcohol 2 nights a week and am concerned about any interaction there, as well.</p><p>I appreciate any recommendations for supps to try and/or dosage times-- thank you in advance for your advice!</p><p>Current supplements (as a petite female, the numbers probably seem a bit low :) ):</p><p>--AM</p><p>Fish oil pills</p><p>Vit B complex (includes folic acid, inositol, choline and high dosage of b12)</p><p>Vit C (300mg-1000mg)</p><p>Vit D (just upped to 2,000 IU)</p><p>--PM</p><p>Zinc (50 mg around dinnertime)</p><p>Magneisum (300 mg)</p>
