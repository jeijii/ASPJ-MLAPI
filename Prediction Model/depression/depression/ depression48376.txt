<p>I will only take Wellbutrin … because I also had been on paxil years ago.. and I gained 40 pounds and was extremely lethargic …  and having an eating disorder,  it made me more depressed… so I refuse to take anything with side effects  that says "may cause weight gain" because it will, there is no maybe about it…  and then I take trazodone at night… between the two..
