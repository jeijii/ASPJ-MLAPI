<p>I started taking Prozac, 10mg and its been about 3 weeks. I feel wonderful, but the sexual side effects are not going to work for me at all. I still have the drive but hard to you know.... and I don't want to give that up.  Can anyone offer any of their own experiences with something different to try that will not affect me in that department, or have the least amount of affect. I do take xanax .25 maybe once per day for anxiety as well.</p><p>Thanks!</p>
