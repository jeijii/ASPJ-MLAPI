<p>ECT isn't as bad as most people think.  I began my treatments about 1 year ago, after many hospitalizations, and trying dozens and dozens of different meds and med combinations.  ECT has been the only treatment to be even somewhat effective for me.  I was 16 yrs old when my treatment began, and suffer from depression, SI, anxiety, and a few "maybe" diagnoses.  I also had anorexia for 7-8 yrs.  After the treatments (3x a week, for maybe 2-3 weeks) I felt amazing.  I credit the ECT for helping me recover from my eating disorder, and it really helped my depression.  It was incredible.  </p><p>The effects began to fade after a few months, so after a few "boosters" I began maintenance ECT, which is less frequent.  This was helpful, though as the ECT trailed off/stopped, my mood plummeted.  Personally, I would highly recommend it to someone who has tried many methods without success and cannot function with their degree of depression.  </p><p>Also, remember there are different types of ECT.  I'm not going to pretend I fully understand how it works, but its something to talk to your doctor about.  There's right unilateral, ultrabrief, bilateral, and possibly others.  Research shows different amounts of effectiveness with each kind and also amount of side effects (particularly memory loss).  </p><p>I've had different levels of memory loss, but it tends to come back and is not too severe.  And I think my mood getting better is more important than me being able to remember someone's phone number or something.  I had my treatments outpatient, though some places require them to be done inpatient.  For me, it was very simple:  walk in, blood pressure/temp, wait, lie on table, get anasthesia thing, fall asleep, wake up, be monitored for like 10 min, go home, sleep.  Sometimes you wake up with a bad headache or particularly sleepy.  But its really not that bad.  </p><p>Well, whatever you decide, I wish you the best.  Good luck!</p>
