<p>It sounds like nothing a speed cleaning day can't cure.</p><p>And the kids will be fine.  They'll just tell the truth.  Little ones are like that "the house is clean when mommy's happy, but when she cries alot and goes to the doctor it gets a little messy.  Yeah, I get supper and lunch and clean clothes and baths and go to school and do my homework"</p><p>Piece of cake, kid.  You'll come through roses.</p><p>They can't take your kids because your sick.  You have a good support system, it's just still fine tuning.</p><p><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_wwww.gif" alt=":wwww:"><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_shocked.gif" alt=":shocked:"><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_sneaky2.gif" alt=":sneaky2:"></p><p>Love you bunches</p>
