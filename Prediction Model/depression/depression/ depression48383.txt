You  posted ~10 days before your ECT thread about having started Lyrica +  Geodon, you should really give that combo at least a few weeks. In general from your posts on here you seem to try something for a week or two, decide you don't like it, then go make your pdoc give you something else. Most medications require at least 3-4 weeks at the right dose for you to get real benefit. If you think you're genuinely in danger, you should maybe consider going inpatient until you have meds sorted out. If you keep bouncing around different treatment options you just end up making yourself even more treatment resistant.</p><p>Hope that whatever you choose goes well for you though.</p><p></p></div></blockquote><p>you are right. i dont give medication enough time to work and that messed up my brain. i have a new dr he put me 5 days ago on Lithium and anafranil</p><p>lithium has stopped the suicidal thoughts now i am waiting for Anafranil to kick.</p>
