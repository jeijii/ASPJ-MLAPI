<p>Hi Jesluvmk,</p><p>I am doing both, I have been in talk therapy for 3 years and I have been medicated for a year and a half. I find the combination to be the most helpful for me.</p><p>I recently changed therapists because we got stuck and so now I have a new t. with a different approach, hoping that will be even more beneficial.</p><p>Good luck to you, and yes, find a t. that you can grow to trust, otherwise you are loosing out and won't get the best outcome.</p><p>SN <img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"></p>
