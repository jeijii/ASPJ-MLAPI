			I thought I would share a good experience I have had with treatment that seems to be working for me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			As background, I have had depression almost my whole life due to growing up in a troubled family. Was prescribed Valium at age 12 for severe anxiety issues, took it for a year. I started taking Prozac in 2000 after a major nervous breakdown. About 3-4 years ago Prozac stopped working so I tried Celexa (horrible experience, sleepy all the time), then settled on Wellbutrin + Prozac. It worked ok except for some symptoms that didn't go away, specifically extreme tiredness, memory problems, and lack of motivation. 
		</p>

		<p>
			At my last visit my doctor suggested adding Provigil (modafinil). <strong>It is not labelled for depression</strong>, it is for narcolepsy and to help people who work night shifts. It is not an amphetamine, and has a very low risk of dependence. I am on 100mg split between half tablet in the morning and half after lunch.
		</p>

		<p>
			I cannot describe how much it has helped me. I finally have enough energy to go through my day and to take care of my chores and obligations. My memory and cognition has improved. Rather than feeling overwhelmed, I almost look forward to getting things checked off my to-do list. My exhaustion was putting so much stress on me, and contributing to my depression. I felt worthless because I couldn't pull my weight, and my family had to pick up the slack. I spent so much energy mentally kicking myself to get up and get things done, that I would have none left for the actual tasks to do. A month after I started taking it I actually cried of joy and relief when it dawned on me how much my quality of life had improved. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Like all medications, every person responds differently, this is only my personal experience. I just wanted to share it and let people know it can be possible to find some treatment that really helps. I hope others also find relief from their struggles.
