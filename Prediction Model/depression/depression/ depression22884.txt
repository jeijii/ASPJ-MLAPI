I said my cats even hate me. I'm on alot of pain meds since cancer surgery in 96. 1 of them is Fentanyl patch which is on all the time. With that and my other pain meds is it possible that a cat can smell the scent of meds &amp; that is why I think they hate me? I treat them very good but they just avoid me. They go to my husband &amp; love him so much it breaks my heart they won't be with me. </span></span></p>
