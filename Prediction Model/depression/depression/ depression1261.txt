I very much agree with you. DF is the most marvelous, supporting, touching place...I find such beauty in this place. I find it scary to imagine me not entering Google, typing that word "depression", on that gloomy summer day, and finding this forums. I find myself telling my therapist about DF, and how I've reached to the point of being able to say I love those people, wholeheartedly. Because they are amazing. This place is full of love, and light. I am so thankful for being apart of this great community. </span></p><p><span style="color:#000000;">I love you guys, </span></p><p><span style="color:#000000;">Keren. </span><img src="https://www.depressionforums.org/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_hearts.gif" alt=":hearts:"><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p></div></blockquote><p>Hi Karen,</p><p>Yes, i too talk to my psychologist, psychotherapist and psychiatrist about DF. They always seem to be interested in what we talk about here. When tell them they don't always seem to approve, i have no idea why.....except the fact that i can become emotionally stressed if someone i know is having a hard time, because i care....but i can't see how that's bad. I have learnt not to get too wrapped up in other peoples problems lest it should badly affact me and i think that that is sufficient emotional protection. I have benefitted so much more than i have suffered being here, and it has become key support in my recovery to stability.</p><p>I think my medical professionals should just log in and have a look for themselves, they may not be so disapproving then.....</p><p>Helly.
