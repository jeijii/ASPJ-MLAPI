That's a really good question to ponder on.. Some might view this as weird or crazy but to be honest, I see everyone as human beings. Some having more troubles than others, even if they are criminals or things of that nature. A thing that I do find a little sad is that, speaking of criminals, I wonder if they ever really TALK with the prisoners or make an effort to see what's going on with them. Depending on the situation, some do what they do for a reason. For whatever reason they did said thing, I think that those working at the jail can at least help them grow from that deed and learn from that as well instead of only doing the physical labor and whatever else they may do in jails/prisons. Some even get sentenced to death with which that is not in our control but the jury. Even though the person that is sentenced to such a punishment, I can't help but feel sorrow for them because they just now officially lost the ultimate privilage given to them since their first breath. Though there can be 'mad' people out there, I still remember no one is built perfectly and no one is guaranteed to be a good person if that makes sense. <br><br>   Though they may be deemed 'cold-blooded' or what have you, they're still made of the same flesh and blood as you and I and the same organs and everything. Some of the known criminals in history so far (that I've read) have had a rough child hood which saddens me because they could have had it better. Though the other portion just snaps just like that for no reason whatsoever. And so, as complex as the human being is along with their mind and emotions, I don't know if we'll ever know the true concrete answer to that question. The knowledge of how these sorts of people and how they work is beyond me but hey, I'd definitely be willing to learn more about this sort of thing in the future. <br><br>   Though with hearing your voice (well, reading technically..), what has been woven into your personality/character is something that you can't control but something that you possibly could have been born with..(not sure, not a professional haha, but just an educated guess!  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> ) So I don't really see why you should be denied any rights and be treated less of a human. Instead maybe helping said person learn how to live with/deal with those traits.. though I think maybe in the eyes of you and others with similar traits won't really see anything wrong with them considering you've had this behaviour all your life so far, therefore that's the norm for you. However others that are very different from you are not. Sorry if I seem like I'm picking or prodding at you, don't mean to do that! Just that I've never met someone such as you and it's really interesting, just like how you find sensitive/shy people and their reactions as interesting! <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"> Plus it really works my brain and helps me look at lots of different perspectives.<br><br>   And also encourages me in a way.. Ever since I could remember, I was very quiet as a child. Even when I was a baby, I didn't cry! xD As I grew throughout elementary school, the shyness developed more and of course I was still quiet. Now that I think back on it, I was definitely more of an observant person as well (and still am today). Then when middle school came, along with other problems accompanying me, the shyness grew to anxiety and it was harder for me to do what normal people would do. It felt as if I were in a cage with an open door. Even though the door is open, I just can't come out. I'm stuck and I feel trapped. At times when this anxiety got bad, I'd feel light-headed and short of breath and I feel like I'm being slowly choked. You'd instantly be able to guess I absolutely HATE public speaking of any kind. I used to have this communication applications class back in 9th grade. After I explained my anxiety to her, she said that after I speak a few times in front of the class that it'll be fine. I was not fine even though I did countless presentations. I so desperately wanted to hide out in the bathroom and skip that class altogether..But I didn't have the balls to do that so I didn't. xD haha! <br><br>   But anyways, that's just an insight of how it felt for me. What I meant by that this encourages me is that it encourages me to do better in terms of anxiety. Don't let it control me like it has for the past year/2 years. It encourages me to get over that obstacle and to continue not giving a crap what others may think about me as a person or about how my hair is or what I wear etc... It encourages more of a thicker skin basically! Though with others it may be different. <br><br>   My goodness, sorry I wrote such a long response! &gt;.&gt; I get quite talkative a lot of the time, which is funny because it's so contradictory with my anxiety xD But oh well! If you have any questions though, feel free to ask! I feel like I'm asking to much questions.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br><br> -- Mon Sep 28, 2015 4:28 pm -- <br><br> I just realized what such a funny coincidence this is! I'm literally at this moment doing a school assignment about bullying and at the same time responded to your thread! xD
