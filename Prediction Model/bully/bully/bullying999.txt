				I know this isn't a courtroom but I don't know if you have heard any ideas stating that the perception of the actions, words, etc of a person holds more weight in a courtroom when evidence is limited.  A person who lunges at another but, at the same time, making ot look like an attack, will be thoroughly questioned because of the way the act was perceived.  I think the same holds true for words.
