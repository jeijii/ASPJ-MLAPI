				Hi,<br><br>It seems that there has been an awful lot of 'red tape' here (i.e. bureaucracy), but not enough talking face to face as humans.  I am not familiar with the American education system as I was raised in Ireland, but I know only too well how silly rules can interfere in situations like this.  as I see it, there is no right or wrong here, and the ideal outcome would be that Michael can resume his study without letting anyone else upset/anger him.  If you have not already done so, then I suggest arranging an informal 'chat' with the school principle, and to bring Michael along to it.  Any decsion made about Michael's future should involve him too, after all.<br><br>Kevin
