<br>Learning to set boundaries between ourselves and others is essential to our emotional health.  Being assertive does not necessarily have to be damaging to the other party.  Some of the biggest bullies I have ever encountered have been tamed with tact and appeal to their better judgement.
<br>
<br>Can all bullies be handled this way, of course not.  But learning how to use tact for the 95% of the rest of the people we come into contact with is better than using the "survival of the fittest" (or baddest) technique.
<br>
<br>The young bully who continues to use his might to achieve his means will never be successful in the world.  Civilized people will shun him, and there will always be a bigger bully ready and willing to cut him down to size.
<br>
<br>Settling differences, whether in the schoolyeard or the workplace, has to go beyond brute force and focus on maintaining respect for ourselves as well as the other party.  Not child's play but more productive in the end.
<br>
<br>Best,
