This doesnt mean he cares. It just means he sees you as a decent enough entertainment source, when and how he feels like it. Or i might be totally wrong, either way you should try and move on because as everyone else said, this is not working out.</div></blockquote><br><br>I know he doesn't care, he never has, obviously and even if he came back I know it wouldn't be because he cares. <br>I just find it strange that someone who blocks you keeps you in his contact list. I think any other person including me, if I am done with someone to the point of blocking them then, I would get rid of them on my list too. If someone blocks you on Skype then on my contact list he would show as not having shared his details with me and that is not the case so I am 99% sure he has me in his contact list still. I tested it with someone else and when they deleted me their profile showed as not sharing details with me and with a question mark on their profile.
