				I would like to know what makes people find another kid in their school 'weird'.  Here's a way to stop a bully, when I teased anyone they used to laugh at me, so just laugh at what thebully says, to their face, and keep laughing no matter the insult. OR keep saying what what ?? i cant hear ya.. what?" and they will respond by saying 'psycho' or something else becuz they cant handle it or you can continue to go 'blaaaaaaaa  aaaaa   aaaaa' while they are talking and then you cant hear them and they wont know what to do so they will walk away.. man wish someone had told me this in junior high school.
