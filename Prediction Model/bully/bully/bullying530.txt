You seem quite firm and to the point in your post, perhaps if you act similarly in real life with the teachers, they are under the impression that this is the style of interaction that you prefer and are actually trying to be nice by reciprocating it?<br><br>For example, I'm not a particularly warm, huggy type of person in real life and in general I don't appreciate it when people get all hug around the waist type of chummy on me. Some people pick up on my demeanour and know not to go down the overly friendly route; this may be what people are thinking when they come across your style of interacting, trying to respond in kind to the kind of interaction you are supplying them with.<br><br>I'm not sure if this is the case or not, I'm just throwing it out there as an idea for you to consider.</div></blockquote><br><br>yes i have considered this i happen to be a little assertive person who would like to argue (in a healthy manner) but am willing to confront when it has to come to that....but i also like to respect people and would like to be formal in situation, specially in this particular situation when its my kid's school. there i start nice but when not met in an appropriate behavior then have this tendency to 'fight back' instead ignoring and 'give it a time'...this is something i need to learn...<br><br>having said that the area generally is single/ white dominated, literary and employment rate is generally low....people would like to intimidate you but when show some nerves them would like to immediately soften up and pretend to be victimised....<br><br>anyways...
