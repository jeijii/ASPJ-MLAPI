				Let me say this. This kind of behavior will not be tolerated in society for much longer. I will pass comprehensive legislation demanding strict prison sentencing for all bullies aged 9 and up when I am elected to office.

We will not give up defending and protecting the weak, and we trust that they will not give up hope. It will be a while before the necessary changes can be made but for now you will have to go through the legal system, as crooked or unjust or insufficient as it may be until we can get a new plan in place.
