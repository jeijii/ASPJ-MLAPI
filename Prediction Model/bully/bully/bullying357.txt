				I'm so very sorry about your daughter, I'm so glad the bullying stopped for her and I hope that she's okay now. My parents know about the bullying as they did try to tackle it a few times but my school just didn't care (I'm from England and bullying commonly has a blind eye turned to it in the area I am from) so I did move schools and luckily I was very happy at my new school despite only having a year left of school as a whole. My parents don't know how much it still affects me daily though and I don't really want to bring it up to them because it was a rough chapter in all of our lives and I'm scared of my mum worrying about me and things, I hadn't thought of speaking to a professional though. That's something I will definitely look into. Thank you so much for your advice and again I really hope your daughter is doing okay, kids can be cruel <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad">
