				With all due respect to your feelings about this, I don't really consider this abuse/bullying behavior.  He probably just doesn't care to be friendly towards you, for reasons of his own which have little to do with who you are.  Which isn't very nice or fair, perhaps, but hardly bullying. He should be professional, yes, but unless there is someone around to remind him of being that way, and with the clout to do so, he can pretty much act friendly with whoever he wants and shun the rest.  I've been the target of bullying/mobbing in several workplaces in years past, and believe me, after being around people who were in my face every day and threatened to kill me, I' can tell you that working with someone , and on a temporary basis at that, who just leaves you alone and gives you the cold shoulder is much more preferable and hardly worth a care.  Let him be someone else's problem and for that matter, maybe he is testing you but all you have to do is mentally move on. You don't need to even try to 'solve' this one. Try listening to self-help hypnosis tapes about self-esteem and self-confidence so the next time you meet someone who doesn't like you back (and shows it in this manner), you can shrug it off more easily and still be comfortable in your own skin.
