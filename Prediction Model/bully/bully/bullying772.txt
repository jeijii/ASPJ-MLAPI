				Question - Are you sure this is whats going on?<br><br>I would start by going to one of the people who are now against you and ask them straight out why they have turned against you? Ask straight out if the work colleague is bad mouthing and spreading stuff behind your back. Press them until you get what is going on out of them.<br><br>Then go and complain to your manager. If the manager doesnt behave satisfactory to your complaint go and complain about the manager and employee to HR. Quite often weak employees and weak managers who cannot cope being targetting by the employee not only side with them but... and this is the oddball part.... they allow all their views and opinions to be shaped by them.
