				Hey,<br>For the record I'm really glad you made friends with a trans girl, as one myself I can say friends are scarce enough and those that are around matter a lot. My ex best friend, saved me from self harm so many times I can't even count, even if she worked alongside Valkyrie for it. As for the homophobe, you have to do something about them, if it is an alter, suppressed it is the worst thing possible, when I was first learning about my alters there was a particular one I suppressed and she ended up become very abusive until I allowed myself to learn more about her and accept her. Try to learn more about them, you don't have to accept them but try to contend with them more often without letting them be abusive or controlling and putting up with them, for a while.<br>I need some rest so I may talk later but good luck<br><br>--Scarlet
