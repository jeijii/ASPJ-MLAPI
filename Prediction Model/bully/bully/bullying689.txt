				hmnn.. a difficult one.. <br><br>It does sound like your friend has some insecurity issues that make him jump on weaknesses..<br><br>alternatively; do you think your friend could be genuinely wondering how on earth you couldn't know that information and just be severely clumsy and unthinking of your feelings..?   It's just that this reminds me of some conversations with a friend of mine who is always devastated to learn that he's upset someone.. he just speaks very bluntly and without thinking through the consequences first.<br><br>If it's the second option, that's tough to solve but worthwhile doing.. have a chat with him and say that he's upsetting you.. ask him to think about your feelings a bit before he speaks..<br><br> if it's the first option then that's even trickier.. if he's doing it out of insecurity then i think it would be a good idea for you to consider complimenting him more on the areas that he is good at.. bolster up his self esteem to balance the scales a bit.. <br><br>that's if you want to keep him of course..  if he upsets you and continues to do these things then a new set of like-minded friends may be more appropriate xx
