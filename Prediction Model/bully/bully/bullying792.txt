I have a 16 year old daughter who went through a little bit of bullying in elementary school.  After I laid in bed ready to go to sleep, she came to me and whispered that a girl was picking on her.  I assured her I would  talk to the principle the next morning and that it would stop.  Have you told your parents?  Are they able to do anything about it.  I know it's sometimes difficult to tell them, but that's what parents are for, to protect you.   To end my story about my daughter, I ended up crying that night she told me of the girl picking on her, and the next day, bright and early I told the principle and they took care of it that morning.  The teacher called me and my daughter said the girl apologized to her.  It never happened again after that.  I was so upset this happened to my own daughter.  I am fiercely protective of my kids.<br><br>I think you should see about getting a professional to talk to, and also a close friend.  It always helps to share our troubles with others who care about us, our parents too, so that you feel better and feel like there is help for you so that you can be completely well.  And also this helps to put it behind you as a distant memory.
