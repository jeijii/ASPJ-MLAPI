Your post gave me the image of a grown man acting like a child, with the pointing and name calling, which you have to admit is pretty pathetic. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Roswitha wrote:</cite>After this i start to have thoughts like "what could had happened if he had meet me late at night on an empty street or at the beach" or " why i did nothing against him back then" or "i am responsible for what happened"and also i start to develop a phobia about meeting him again.</div></blockquote><br><br>If the extent of his bullying back in school was verbal, I wouldn't worry about it. It's probably the only power he has. If it happens again, give him some kind of reaction, similar to how you would appease a small child having a temper tantrum, because basically that is what he is doing. Maybe a look of mock sadness, as if to say "Oh, that's how you USED TO make me feel bad, but I'm over it now, but obviously you are not, so boo-hoo, here's a bone, little doggie." <br><br>Of course this could egg him on. Here's another way to show him that you're both adults now: call a cop. Back in the day, he might have gotten a slap on the wrist for teasing a schoolmate (although I'll bet he never did) but now you're both adults, and it's not teasing, it's <span style="text-decoration: underline">harassment</span>.  <br><br>But the best response, should you run into him again, is to ignore him. Don't let yourself be an instrument for him to work out his issues. You are NOT responsible for what happened back then, and it is of no fault of yours that you did nothing against him. It's nearly impossible for many to confront a bully as a kid. I know this, as I was bullied too.<br><br>Besides, you did say it happened in your hometown, and you were just visiting, right? Be happy that you've moved on with your life, he hasn't, and probably never will.
