				I'm sorry to hear that you have been through bad experiences of being bullied. I think it is great that you are reminding people that it does eventually get better and to stay strong. I think building up your support networks such as having people you can relate to here on the forum or elsewhere in your life is also an important tool to help get through the difficult time of being bullied.
