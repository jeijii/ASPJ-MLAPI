				Hey there Giulia<br><br>Im no further forward with the pain management service unfortunately, though thanks for asking. <br>My GP tried to get.somebody to see me sooner, but it did no good.  Ive recently written a letter to the service to  see if i have better luck persuading them but not sure im conf<br>ident its made any difference.  They should be seeing me in the Summer at any rate, i guess at least its not too  far away now.   No, cant say ive ever been asked to take an IQ test, i don't think its standard practice for my GP service to offer those to patients!    My mental health really isnt too good just now, bit of a long complicated story there, but my GP is doing what he can to get me help.<br><br>Im really glad you got to have your MRI done, and are in the process of receiving help soon, though at the same time am sorry to hear about the brain damage.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad"> Still, at least now the doctors have been <br>able to pick up on what the problem is they're better equipped to do something about it.  I really hope things go well for you when you see your Neurologist in July, wishing you the best of luck with everything!
