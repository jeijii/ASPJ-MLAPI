				I am a survivor of chronic emotional abuse. One place is full of bullying is online. And people normalize it so much, when I point it out publicly and get offended by condescension or other Narcissistic like tricks, 1. the room divides, or 2, Everyone gets quiet and the bully goes on bullying me. And here and there a person will contact me privately to say they see the bullying to and are sorry, and most say....I don't know what got into him, or her....they aren't usually like that....as in I bring it out in them.<br>When if I do read around I can find other victims...singled out wherever possible like me-treated as bad by that certain person. I basically am aware of a third party behavior that 1. takes no responsibility in calling the bully out-even if they acknowledge it is happening(partially validate my reality), or plays totally dumb to the whole situation whether or not they can define what bullying is: they will not acknowledge the "elephant" bullying behavior is even occurring.<br><br>All outcomes leave me feel disempowered or secondary-bullied in a way no matter what and I feel blamed as if I evoked it, deserved it, etc. I flee chat rooms or forums permanently over this pretty often!
