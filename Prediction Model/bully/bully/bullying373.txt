				I live in the UK and believe that I have been stalked by a group of people.<br>My ex-wife and her malicious family started the trend, and then some junkie mates of theirs spread the rumour that I was a grass and I then started getting picked on by all the drug users in the area that I live.<br><br>Every thick-o drugged up idiot started to give me a hard time, not that I had done anything to any of them, but because they thought and think they are following the criminal code that they are brain washed into believing. Dummies.<br><br>So, for the past 4 years I have been treated with sadistic prejudice by loads of people where I live.<br>If I get a job, someone turns up or someone who works there is involved in drugs.<br>If I start making new friends or woman start taking an interest in me, one of the druggies turns up<br>and slanders / demonizes me, so that no one will go out with me.<br><br>My house has been broken into. My work stolen. My food has been opened and spiked.<br>My marriage was broken up. The scums even got to my doctor and got him to start screwing with my health so I had to leave his surgery.<br><br>Nonetheless, I am lucky in that I am a very resourceful, independent and generally happy person.<br>I am also usually happier when working on art / music etc. <br>So, am probably happier than most of the people whom are smashed out their heads on drugs and booze and who are bullied by the criminal code (that only exists in small minded peoples heads)<br><br>I am also lucky in the fact that I grew up doing martial arts so can fight,<br>so most of the scums do not attack me violently.<br><br>I also realise that being victimised by these scums has sorted out a lot of things in my head.<br>You certainly learn quick what ignorant ass holes people are, including many people who use to be good mates previously before the slander was cast.<br><br>I guess training in martial arts makes you strong.<br>Also, understanding that slander is simply that.<br>Don't matter if the whole world believes your something if you know your not.<br>Stand strong. Learn to fight. Know yourself.<br><br>If you encounter stalkers. Try and say nothing to them.<br>Ideally find CCTV cameras to stand under. <br>If you are really worried. Perhaps buy yourself a covert surveillance camera that is built into your clothing so if some ass hole is stalking you, you can collect evidence which can be then used to get the police to intervene.<br><br>However, beware that recording people without their permission is an illegal offence in most countries and you can in fact be prosecuted for that in itself.<br><br>Cheers
