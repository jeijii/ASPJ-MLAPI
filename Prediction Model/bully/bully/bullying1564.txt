				I was bullied as early as elementary school, and I hit my darkest moment by the third grade where I struggled with the thought of suicide.<br>In the end, I chose to live, but I know that there are others out there who will make a different choice this year.  I want to try and reach them first, tell them that life can be a better option, and show them through my own story.<br>I've written it all down in a short memoir and posted it up for free.  The only thing I ask from you now is to please give it a rating, tell me if it can help others, or if my story was a valiant attempt but ultimately not helpful.<br>There is no other place where I crave for help more.  I know other people on this forum have seen far worse than I have, and so it is your opinions that I will value the most.<br><br>*Link Removed by Mod - If you would like to participate, please PM user*<br><br>In advance,  thank you.
