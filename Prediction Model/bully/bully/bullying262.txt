				Hi everyone,<br><br>I tend to agree for the most part with Owsi68, except for the marked for life part for seeking help.  HIPPA protects from that.  <br><br>I’d like to add that in adult bullying, it has been linked to high blood pressure, early onset of diabetes, hypertensive crisis, heart attack, stroke and GI Issues.  And of course let’s not forget the suicide and murder suicide as with targeted children. <br><br>I remember when I was younger, my parents got involved and strongly advocated for my rights as wells as involving the police with the bully’s family and school.  As adults, that’s not there.<br><br>Also, as a target who had witnesses, hospitalizations (medical reasons), and documentation, it IS legal and there is no support for the target unless it is physical.  There is more ridicule that as adults, we should know how to deal with a bully or grow a skin or the infamous “If you don’t like it, leave” comments.<br><br>Matter of fact, my adult bully changed corporate policy so I couldn’t have access to medical care when I was on a medication that required monitoring.  I couldn’t get monitored and it put me in the hospital.  I was out for weeks recovering.  What happened?  It was just discussed with my perpetrator and that was it.  So for me adult bullying is WAY worse, because it can kill you in many more ways.   <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad"> <br><br>Since 2008, it has gotten so far out of hand.  Companies treat it as a dirty little secret.  It just needs to be illegal and all organizations need to be violence free, period.  My very humble opinion.
