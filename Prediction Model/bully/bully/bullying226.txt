				I would like to ask, is your name really Willow?  If it is, what a beautiful name!!!  (We named our daughter Willow  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink">  shes almost 4 yrs old)  
<br>
<br>The trick with bullying is to OUT SMART them.  In your case this will probably be hard cause they know too much about you.  This is what I think that this bully is doing.
<br>
<br>First she became friends with you.  You trusted her to know and understand what made you happy, sad, ect.  She learned a lot about you.  Then she started to become the bully by picking out little things that you would never think would normally effect you and then start going after you about them.  You stopped being friends with her and hanging out.  So she had no way of learning more about you, except through new friends you made along the way afterwards so she could conitnue her abuse.  She likes to have followers and she like to divide and conquer, going after one person who is alone.
<br>
<br>I am sure you are not the only one she bullies.  My suggestion is to find another ex-friend of hers or another victim of hers.  Just talking to them will driver her CRAZY cause she will think that you are constantly talking about her.  Of course your making a friend but she is too self consious to think that.  Everytime you laugh at what this other person says, she will think it is about her.  She will think that you know her weaknesses but you will not be alone anymore and her picking will be faced with two of you side by side.  IF she indead has Anti-Social personality disorder, which she probably does, than she is playing mind games.  It is actually sad that her current "friends" got sucked up by her cause she has no emotion to or for them what so ever.  When these other people make fun of you too because of her, feel sorry for them.  They are not as strong as you.  They are like helpless children.  If you still care about any of them, look them in the eyes with looks that say YOU feel sorry for THEM.  She feels NOTHING for anything, period.  The best thing with people like this is to get back into their heads.  
<br>
<br>She is going to be self consious about everything about herself. So try this,
<br>Dont be afraid to look her in the eye.  Show absolutly no reaction to what she says at all, ever.  (save it up for when you are away from her)  Even if that means you have to crank some loud song inside you head and repeat the words over and over so your mouth and face dont react.  While shes talking pretend you dont hear her.  Space off kind of and squint to see something nasty in her hair (that isnt really there), on her shoe, whatever.  Then kind look taken aback as though you have never seen such a thing in such a place before.  (If you have already made a friend, give them an OMG look)  Then shake your head and walk away.  Get creative and do other things like this.  (This works great on self consious teenage boys too!  Gets a good laugh for you and any friend with you, especially if you know they cant stand you cause they have to touch their hair, ect anyway!)  She will not know how to deal with more than one person.  Especially people who have brains.  How old are you?  In HS I am assuming?  Take a psycology class.  This may help you to better understand people like this and give you an edge.  Plus if the school is small, she will know you are taking the class and that will bug her too.  You will be forcing her to have weaknesses against things that do not even exsist.  
<br>
<br>My father is a sociopath (Anti-Social) and I have to play mind games right back at him just to keep him from playing them on me.  He pretends that he is ill when he is not, turns a casual conversation in a way that a person not used to dealing with this may slip out bits of personal info like passwords, picks up other things he can turn around on people if he ever needs to, like I would never even consider saying a harsh word to my children while on the phone with him, ect.  He wants everyone to feel sorry for him but at the same time, think that he is the smartest guy around.  He takes pride in thinking that he has everyone fooled.  As soon as anyone shows a bit of being a step ahead of him, he will try everything he knows, but will eventually back off like a beat puppy cause he doesnt want anyone to figure him out.  He doesnt have friends, he has prisoners.  My brother, his girl friend, brother in law, and my sister all are trapped and believe everything he says.  Hes a good guy with a sad life.  Boohoo.  Get over it.  He is were he is cause he put himself there.  They are weak and refuse to believe that there is anything wrong with him.  He doesnt talk to my husband at all, or to me much for that matter, cause he doesnt want us to get too close.  He literally shakes whenever my high intelligence husband is around him.
<br>
<br>SO try and see into it like this.  Remember, she is sick with something and she only wants to infect as many people as she can to try and make herself feel better.  Try to get a couple friends that are really smart individuals like yourself.  This will scare the crap out of her.
