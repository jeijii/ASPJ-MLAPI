				I'd love to thank my best mate, Jay. He helped me through all these times and we've grown into the best of friends. If it wasn't for him I don't know how I would have coped.<br><br>I'd also like to thank my caring parents for supporting me throughout my ordeals. It was their help at home that put me in a stable state of mind. <br><br>I'd also like to thank the pricks who bullied me for making me the person I am today, and giving me the experience and strength to make it through life, and make life without them feel better.
