				I had a similar thing when I was at school. I thought everyone hated me and I was bullied quite badly. The thing that surprised me most at the time was people who I never considered I'd be friends with came up to me and started talking to me and I eventually became friends with them. They weren't the popular kids I'd normally hang out with but they turned out to be nicer and there was much less drama following them. All I did was smile their way and they said hey.
