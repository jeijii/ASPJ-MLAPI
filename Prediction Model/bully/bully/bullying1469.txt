				I'm so angry right now. In 2015, I lived in a sort of care home whilst going to therapy, because social services couldn't find a flat for me and were reluctant to let me stay in a hostel.<br><br>One day, one of the male staff just walked into my room without knocking, and I was naked. I got dressed, and walked out and confronted him. He replied that I had nothing worth looking at anyway, and that nobody would want to see me naked on purpose. I got really angry and screamed at him about how offended I felt, and that he had invaded my integrity. He just kept on giving me snide remarks. I left the care home and was admitted to a psych ward, because my therapist didn't want me to go back to the home after what had happened.<br><br>Right now, I have just returned home after goin to the shops. The man who had degraded me in the home was standing right behind me in the queue. He was chatting away with his friend like he wasn't bothered at all. Then he left his girlfriend to pay for their stuff, so that he could stand at the end of the till while I was packing my groceries. I couldn't muster up the courage to look at him, I felt so uncomfortable. <br><br>I hate this! I shouldn't feel ashamed and powerless when he is the one who did something wrong.
