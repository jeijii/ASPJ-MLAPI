				Hey,
<br>I get bullied because like most of the kids in my school hate me for reasons that I have no clue about. There's 2 or 3 kids that have pretty much crossed the line into verbal harrassment, but I just ignore it. I only have to put up with it for 2 more years, and that's nothing compared to 11 years of dealing with it before. I was bullied in all my new schools because I was the new girl in the school and I didn't have any friends. My family isn't exactly what you would call the greatest, and when I was always moving when I lived with my mom, we lived in some pretty run down places because my mom was a college student and a single parent of 2 at the time. 
<br>A reason that I get bullied in the school that I've been in now for 8 years is because of my weight and the way I look, but other than that... I don't know why I get bullied.
<br>Anyways, I don't feel like typing up much more about this right now because I'm really stressed from the first week of school and tired, so I'll add more to this when I get a chance.
