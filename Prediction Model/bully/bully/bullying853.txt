				Hi, I'm 42 now and I was a bully. I can tell you now that I lived all my life with regrets for all the bad things I did to others. The reason why I was a bully was because I never put my self in the other's shoes, I never stoped to think what this kid is feeling or why is this way, I did it just to have fun, just to prove how funny I could be. I have 2 teenager sons and as a mother I was always scared that they found in their way someone like I was when I was a child. Fortunately my boys haven't been bullied, and they don't know I was a bully, I would feel very ashamed if they found out that part of my life because I have tought them to always respect their mates, to think before they act or say something offensive and to try to imagine others feelings. I stoped being a bully when I changed of school and tried to be the way I was in my old school and nobody laughed of my disrespect to others, also because my targets confronted me and acused me with the school authorities, bullies are cowards, they don't mess with the ones that stop them at the first attempt, no matter what, tell your teachers or your parents when someone is trying to abuse you. Hope all the parents teach their kids to respect others, only that way others will respect them. See you.
