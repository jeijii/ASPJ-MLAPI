				You see, at my school, there's this boy (I Cannot Tell You His Name, So I'll Refer To Him As C) at my school. He has bullied me ever since *mod edit* grade. It started with me having different beliefs than him, so he was constantly insulting me, calling me "Dirty" and "Loser" among other names. However, this year, in *mod edit* grade, it got physical. Because I shared my beliefs, he charged at me, and I only managed to escape just in time. However, I got into BIG trouble because everybody accused me. C is very has lots of friends (Who sometimes join in on the bullying) and of course, they ALL said it was my fault. I don't have any friends at my school, so they all accused me of having different beliefs, and because of it, I got in trouble. This has been continuing for several months, and I need help. Please, if anyone can give me advice, I'll be thankful.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad">
