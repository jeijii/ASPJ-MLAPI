				Sounds like Joe has wormed his way in and made himself the centre of activity.  At first his influence seems to be positive, but like with the church he ran its only a matter of time before it all crumbles. Slowly people will realise he is not as good as he seems, a wolf in sheep's clothing.<br>Making his 'own little group' is totally out of order especially as<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>btw, two other female board members (out of ten) are living with him, and a third is related to him by marriage.</div></blockquote><br>Nepotism, not fair at all. <br><br><br>What would I do? Ummm not easy. If I liked the job I really would not want to leave.<br>I would hang on in there as long as possible.<br><br>I discovered that I'm so good trying to be a 'nice person' that I shoot myself in the foot sooo;<br><br>You say you don't like gossip, I don't either. BUT I found one way to fight the 'Joe's' of this world is to subtly undermine them (because that's what they do to you)---------------------------with gossip.<br>I tried this once in a similar situation, and to my amazement it worked.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br><br>Remember bullies thrive on silence, it is their friend.<br> <br><br>If I started losing sleep over the job I would start to look for something else, somewhere I would be appreciated more. The Joe's of this world are a bit of a nightmare.  For every person who realises he's a unpleasant control freak there will be one who thinks he's the best thing since sliced bread.<br><br>I think you could find another job, you sound like a real nice person.
