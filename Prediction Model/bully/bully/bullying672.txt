<div class="content">
				
				I am sorry those people in college are so cruel.  They are not worth knowing. <br>You are above that name calling and labeling.  I know it hurts and makes you angry but they are not worth wearing orange and going to prison for by killing them, are they?  Try to ignore those cruel people and focus on the nicer people.  The cruel ones are not worth your time.
