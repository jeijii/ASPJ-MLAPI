				I have experienced much of the same thing that you have. I'm not sure if this effects anything but I have Asperger's Syndrome, (At least I was diagnosed with it, I personally don't care and it hasn't changed anything), which causes me to have difficulty with social signals, cues, etc. I have been manipulated and taken advantage of many times, and each time the pain remains with me. However, our minds are safe places, and are separate from what occurs on the "outside". Think of yourself as a castle, you are the king and you have COMPLETE control over the inside (except for a few subconscious processes). You can allow the insults in and process them or push them out and ignore them. Either way, they will never go away, but that's because your brain is holding onto them to protect you in the future. My advice would be to accept them as an added protection, another layer of armor, because that's what they are. Every scar just heals stronger, it's just the skin that looks ugly. At least that's what I think, I'm not really sure how to word what I did to help me, but hopefully this helps you.
