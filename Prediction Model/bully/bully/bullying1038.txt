				I think a lot of people here, may need to wake up. Bullies are not insecure or abused.  Bullies are some of the most confidant and emotionally secure people I know. I have been bullied since I was five and I am still bullied. People bully for the same reason children tear the wings off of insects, power and the pleasure they get in making something else squirm with pain (emotional or physical).There is nothing 'wrong' with bullies or their upbringing, they simply feel better about themselves if there is someone they can 'play' with. Most bullies (from personal experience) don't think what they are doing is causing much emotional pain, it simply doesn't occur to them.
