				I hope you're wrong and bullying has decreased. I know there are a lot of anti-bullying groups and campaigns now. Also, I hope the victims of bullying are standing up for themselves now either by using fists or calling the police on them since teachers and principals don't want to do anything apparently. What really makes me FURIOUS is that jackass principal at Columbine knew Eric and Dylan were getting bullied and he did nothing!!! Are the jocks really that important in high school to protect them at all costs just because they are on that schools sports team?
