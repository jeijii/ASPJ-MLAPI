				I'm a teenage girl and I have no friends at school. My old group now hates me because they think that I deleted their instagram accounts but it was actually a few of my close friends that I do theatre with. My old best friend (we have been best friends since kindergarten) was pulled away from me by a girl that hates me and now she is popular and despises me. There are people that I sit with, however they are in the year below me. My mum is mad at me because I'm not popular and that I should be otherwise I'm gonna be lonely all my life. I have also suffered many cases of bullying when I was younger due to a small disability in my left shoulder. Can anyone give me some advice?
