				"But if he were to tell the story, i might find that its your behaviour that seems unreasonable."<br><br>I don't understand how you think my behavior can be unreasonable.  I didn't realize forgetting to do things, or not wanting to have sex at certain times was a "behavior"...I thought those were things that everyone does?  I'm just tired of being yelled at daily for every little thing that I do.  If you think that I should let him make me have sex when I have a yeast infection, or let him yell at me without saying anything at all just because he doesn't like the way I put a glass in the dishwasher, then I think you have a very strange perspective.
