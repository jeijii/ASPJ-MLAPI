My ex best friend, saved me from self harm so many times I can't even count, even if she worked alongside Valkyrie for it. As for the homophobe, you have to do something about them, if it is an alter, suppressed it is the worst thing possible, when I was first learning about my alters there was a particular one I suppressed and she ended up become very abusive until I allowed myself to learn more about her and accept her. Try to learn more about them, you don't have to accept them but try to contend with them more often without letting them be abusive or controlling and putting up with them, for a while.<br>I need some rest so I may talk later but good luck<br><br>--Scarlet</div></blockquote><br>Yeah, she's not very accepted. I'm trying to be a nice person at my new school. The one benefit of moving is that I can be nicer and act straight/asexual to the people who would harm me if they knew the truth. People can be really homophobic... Anyhow, I don't suppress him/it, because he/it is as much a part of me as I am. I don't let them affect me. But they can be great friends and confidantes if I need them
