Maybe because you were there, easy to string along (i know it sounds bad), reacted in a way that made it easy for him to play with you, and gave him attention. For some people the attention is never enough so they can juggle many things like this at the same time. He sounds emotionally abusive yes.</div></blockquote><br><br>I think I mentioned it here before, but although he has blocked me on Skype (and whatsapp too) he didn't delete me from his contact list on Skype. I know because his profile would show with an interrogation mark as if he hadn't shared details with me if he had deleted me. I keep wondering why would he keep me in his contact list (although blocked) if he is done with me. Does this make sense at all?
