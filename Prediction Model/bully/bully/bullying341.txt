				I agree with some of what you've said. Kids and teens are educated about bullying, told it's wrong and lead to believe it's a childhood thing, but it's not. I think that's one of the first things we learn as adults, the bullying never really stops, it's just different.<br><br>I don't think children should be allowed to bully because adults do, how does that help anything? I think more awareness about adult bullying and adult anti-bullying campaigns would be a great idea. The anti-bullying campaigns geared towards children is still excellent, even with the adult bullying going on. It will still reach and help many children.
