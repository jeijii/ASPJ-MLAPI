I was sent to the counselor last year after I got a horrid note drew on my locker. I hated it and soon our meetings went from helping me with bullying to her always asking me to use my artistic talent to draw posters for an anti-bullying group... So I just waited until the year ended. <br>I was so relieved the school year ended that my depression was lifted. But when I went back to school, it came back.<br><br>I can't be friendly to them, I am the person who holds grudges. If you have been terrible to me before, I do not want you to experience joy in your life again. And it's sick of me as a person to want that, but I do. <br>When someone bullies me, I hate them forevermore. Just seeing them in the hall dampens my day.<br><br>I am not the person who cowers from the bullies, I fight back. I outweigh them in brains and strength, they beat me by sheer numbers.<br><br>At the beginning of the year, I told the two friends I had just met that I was the enemy of the school, and everyone hated me. They thought I was exaggerating. I asked them in the second semester if they still thought I was exaggerating, and they said no. I told you this to show you I am not the only one who knows this.<br><br>My two friends don't stand up for me, because they don't know what to do, apparently. I don't want them gone, because then I'll be alone again, and it'll be worse.</span></span>
