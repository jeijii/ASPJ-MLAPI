				i almost lost my launch when i read all off this people who never been tease them self should shut up and not talk like they know about it.<br><br>I hate how people always saying to act this way when being tease when they was never tease. <br><br><br> (Ann Bishop, who teaches violence prevention curriculums, tells her students to respond to an insult with a non-defensive question: "Why would you say that?" or "Why would you want to tell me I am dumb (or fat) and hurt my feelings?")<br>this is terrible advice i mean terrible if you do this the bully will laugh their head offs and will will help their point of how stupid you or asking such a question or they will say because it true or say because i fell like ti got a problem with it then hit you.<br><br><br>(Communication experts suggest teaching your child to address the bully beginning with "I want" and say firmly what he wants changed: "I want you to leave me along." or "I want you to stop teasing me)<br>this will provoke them to take phy action on you since you treating their power and to bully power is every thing.<br><br><br><br>(Consider helping your child create a statement agreeing with her teaser. Teaser: "You’re dumb." Child: "Yeah, but I’m good at it." or Teaser: "Hey, four eyes." Child: "You’re right, my eyesight is poor.") <br>If a child did this then the bully can easily spread what they said around the school then instead of one pack of bully you have the entire school laughing at you since you agree to that you or like that.<br><br><br>(Bullies love it when their teasing upsets their victims, so help your child find a way to not let his tormentor get to him. A group of fifth graders told me ways they ignore their teasers: "Pretend they’re invisible," "Walk away without looking at them," "Quickly look at something else and laugh," and "Look completely uninterested.")<br>Once again you or provoking them to turn to phy action since you or challenging their power. the higher the grade you in the worse they will do to you if you act like this. As well as because using this will help them start rumors so they can get people who usually leave you alone to see you while they walking past you then start laughing at you.<br><br><br>(Fred Frankel, author of Good Friends Are Hard to Find suggests victims answer every tease with a reply, but not tease back. The teasing often stops, Frankel says, because the child lets the tormentor know he’s not going to let the teasing get to him (even if it does). Suppose the teaser says, "You’re stupid." The child says a rehearsed comeback such as: "Really?" Other comebacks could be: "So?," "You don’t say," "And your point is?," or "Thanks for telling me.")<br>once again you challenging their power and on top off that this leads to rumors it leads to paranoia since while you looking around you see girl you don't even know talking then start laughing towards you. <br>This also they will twist your words and us them right back to make it ten times worse.<br><br><br><br>Uh and you wrong kids who completely love them self's still bully who was always loved at home and love them self or actually usually the main and worse type of bully.  Since they have always gotten what they wont and then they meet some one they don't like so of course for their own pleasure and to gain power they will mess with you and if you try any thing they will become violent.<br><br>Human's Reptilian Brain is the basic instinct of humans. It contain greed, panic, lust, and a lot more and most of them today or trait we see as evil when look one of it at a time. However as a new creature and when we was just like any other animal we needed these to make sure we would not die out it kept us safe alive. <br>Basic instinct is what case bullying most of the time as well as murder, stealing, and all other type of horror of today society. <br><br>Then their the emotion which cause it to. since every person you meet natural puts out chemicals which you absorb.<br>Then right away your brain tells you if it a enemy a friend a mate and so on.  <br><br>Any way as a kid i moved all over and bully every where was treated like dog crap at school and home.<br>And i never had a self esteem problem i never thought of killing my self i have always known that i was smart i was natural athletic. Been told by the Doc who fig out i had asperger that i had a extremely unusual strong will to live.<br><br>explain right fast about what i went through some of the small details. First at home mom did not care for me at all she was stupid and married abusive men to protect her self and my older brother and sister she would toss me out in front.<br>Then her self would beat me with a horse whip among other things for no reason and she let my sibling do what every with me.<br><br>Then at school when i tried some things you said i was badly beating I was Toss into the dumpster one time then the lock was put on it staid in it for a day. Just some of the many things that happened.<br><br>However by 7th grade middle school i fig out how to stop them. Yes if you just fight them a little then ti can get  into a giant fight if you don't completely destroy them.<br><br>Way to take out a real bully is to send them to the hospital for a couple of months. with all of his friends. <br>You destroy him mentally to if you don't he come back stronger.  After the 7th grade when every a bully mess with me i always destroy them phy and mentally. I had a pretty good school life after 7th grade no madder how much we moved since i always kept the bully under control. <br><br>Home got better to since i did the same thing to my siblings and any men mom got into it with or married right up front i let them know what will happen if they touch me. I got to age 16 left home and know starting college after i done some work to get ready at age 19. <br><br>So people who say violence is never the answer or stupid people who never been through great pain and suffering. <br><br>One last thing i will give a example of a guy he was in high school  some one i knew not a friend but he was bullied bad because he was only 5ft tall and he had a very small body structure. <br>One day he followed the leader of the main pack of bully who mess with him and he took a 2by4 and broke it on the guys back.<br>Then rolled him over to make sure he got a good look at him and said next time I'll kill you. The kid was out of school a couple of days then when he came back what happen spread around the school really fast.  After that the bully thought he was crazy so they was to scared to go near him.<br><br>Sorry bad at eng still learniing
