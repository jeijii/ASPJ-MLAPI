				Robinleckert, welcome.  This is a case of bullying on two scales.  First your Goddaughter is being bullied by kids, but secondly and more seriously, she is being bullied by teachers.  No wonder she is so unhappy at school.  Have you thought of taking the matter to the headmistress/headmaster of the school?  If not, I recommend you make an appointment to see them and explain what is going on.  The teachers obviously have no experience at dealing with a student with Aspergers.  Once the Head is aware of what is going on, hopefully the teachers will be disciplined, and the bullying will stop.  If it doesn't, I would suggest you look for an alternative school for your Goddaughter.  Sorry, I've just read that you have been to the Head. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"> Telling a child with Aspergers that they need to be their own advocate, is crazy!  I would seriously think about finding a school which can more closely meet your daughters needs.<br><br>I have a friend who is the Aunt of a child who is deaf(the Mother died of a cancerous brain tumour)and has ADHD.  Due to behavioural problems, the school she attended felt that she was a problem, and basically ostrasized the child from the school.  She now attends a school for children who are deaf and have behavioural problems.  You may find that by putting her in a school that can better deal with her Aspergers, that she will be happier.
