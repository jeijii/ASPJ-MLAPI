				welll, in my school there are these 'school coaches' who come to school every one-two weeks to talk in private with us about personal problems. But its only for half an hour. I have tried to speak to the lady ive been seeing for the last couple months about this, but its hard, i think of the things i heard and it makes me wanna cry, its still really hard, but i know i need some help... It gets worse everyday. Even though im not that shy anymore and i can talk to people in school, speak in front of others, be in front of others, it is still very hard ): Hopefully ill meet the lady again next week, if it starts getting better ill post it here (:
