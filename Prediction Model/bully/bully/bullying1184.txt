				Actually, I think dice has some good points. <br><br>Bullies are not always insecure (in my experience, most of them are, but some are not). Some of them just like doing it for pleasure. It's still sick and it has to be stopped. <br><br>I disagree though with dice's opinion that bullying is warranted. Just because it's a natural part of our evolution doesn't mean it's right. Eating meat is a natural part of evolution. Doesn't mean it's right. <br><br>Also, I was the same as dice when I was young. I purposely isolated myself. People hated me because I was a loner, which I found to be sickening. Just because I don't like socializing doesn't mean that I'm a bad person or a crazed loon. What's even more sickening is that these people who were making jokes about me were teenagers. They should have been old enough to know better. But in any case, it doesn't matter. They never did any real damage, they just made fun of me.
