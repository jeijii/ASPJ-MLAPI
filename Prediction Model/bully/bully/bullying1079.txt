				Study in great detail bullying in all its forms.  Find things you can say at least there is something else.  At least you can find influences while there to make you powerful.  I would make sure that you can't do somethings legally because there might be law makers helping the situation.  I, in my example, needed more debth in the certain topics to get around why it is important to know.  I studied who hurt me the most and just wanted to validate if it just a lifestyle sport extreme jealousy or actually in jail some where .  The worst of the worst people do crap like this basically.  The environment changes often so where I didn't understand I watched the news what is happening in the world to know why people are so etchy.  The media is helpful whether real or not it is happening.   They choose to report it so you gotta listen how are you going to have compassion if you keep yourself away from everything.....
