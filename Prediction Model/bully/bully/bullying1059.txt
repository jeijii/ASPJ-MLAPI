				I had moved out of my parents house at 17 but for some financial circumstances I have had to move back home temporarily. I had forgotten how weird my mother's behavior was. I seriously don't know what to do. She keeps all of my money and decides what I get to spend it on even though I do earn that money she takes my paychecks. she will criticize me and insult me when we go shopping she chooses my shoes and clothes. She even prohibits me from wearing certain underwear. I am 19 so I really think this is not normal. when im not home she calls every 15 minutes to check up on me. She yells and seems angry often then 10 minutes later she acts as if nothing had happened. She never apologizes or seems to realize that sometimes she is wrong. I have never heard her apologize or admit she was wrong, EVER. She seems to think she is perfect and cannot find a flaw within herself. She is always complaining about feeling sick and feeling pain but I am starting to wonder that may be she does it for attention. Every time I share my goals with her she bashes them and reduces me to nothing. I just want a second opinion. I seriously think there is something wrong with her and I feel so trapped because she is my mother but I cannot wait to be done with college and move to another country because I am afraid to become like her.
