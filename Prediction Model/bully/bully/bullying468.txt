				The friend who told you that is not a friend. Such reasoning loses sight of the distinction between attack and defence. When someone attacks you, you have every right to attack them back. It's the Talionic principle, an eye for an eye, though I believe in repaying people in their own coin, with interest. We should show no mercy for the merciless. If someone attacks you, you have the right to defend yourself. We recognize this as valid on the plane of actions, but not so much with words. Instead, we are either enjoined to extend to our victimizers a courtesy they would never extend to us, or to simply ignore them, thereby giving all the bullies freedom to victimize others with impunity.<br><br>In all bullies there abides an appetite only human flesh can satisfy. Such people are figurative cannibals, and the only way to deal with them is to confront them with their own weapons. That's what I do. <br><br>Me, I'm like the Lord of the Rats; the vermin follow me where ever I go. I was bullied at school, and since I've left I have remained a focal point for the human predator. I lack an appearance that provides protective coloration, so it is my fate to be preyed upon by others, a fate to which society abandons most of us marked as the legitimate quarry of the vultures in our midst. <br><br>So I avail myself of whatever expedients are available in my conflicts. This works, because in proportion as a bully loves to mete out humiliating treatment does he hate its requital, or at least this is what experience has taught me. They become comically indignant.
