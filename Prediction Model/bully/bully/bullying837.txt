				I think it was fine to confront your bullies with the truth.<br>You found your voice after all those years. <br>You could have done far worse such as expose them at your<br>School Reunion or to their bosses. Name-calling was going too far<br>in my opinion.<br><br>I'd let it be now if you can. No use dwelling with nasty thoughts.
