				As my name implies my sister says I a nut bag. Let me explain further. She recently obtained her NP and works as a psych nurse with elderly. She claims and has shared this info with family and friends, that I have several personality disorders. She used this to ban me from our fathers hospital and hospice rooms. She also barred me from sitting with family at Dads wake. To top off matters despite the cars being half full I was told to take my own car during the funeral procession. There is more but I'll just start to convo with this.<br>My question to anyone, can she diagnose me then share this info? She claims I asked her. No I did not. I have my own therapist for my psychiatric needs. Where is the line ? It seems the more I defend myself the guiltier I look. As far I know I don't have a personality disorder. Have had depression treated over 20 years ago. That was the last time I spoke to my sister too. She was still looking for baby daddy number 2 for support and not even working. The nurse thing is new. There is also a large amount of $$ from inheritance. I do not know what the deal is with that.<br>Thank you
