				You have to think about this VERY serious problem that can last your sons whole life and cause him to develop personality disorders for not standing up to the bully. 
<br>
<br>I was looking around here because my wife was bullied as a child and now has HPD and has wrecked the better portion of her life because of this very act of which you speak. She was bullied as a kid. Her parents would say to ignore them and my wife became very submissive to the world against her will. This happens for males as well. 
<br>
<br>Let the kid figure this out and figure himself out. Help him to see that there is no winning in fighting a bully but if he HAS to stand up for himself....... then he has to and you should support him in his decision. Take him to get self defense classes and spar with him. You owe to him to secure his coping skills as well as his self defense skills.
<br>
<br> I was bullied as a kid once....... I won!! It gave me confidence that I can't begin to explain. Also gave me respect and sorrow to find out how sad the kid really was. Your son is a little boy in a mean world. Let him talk with you! Fathers are suppost to push their kids to grow and fear less but respect more. A bloody nose isn't that bad and losing is that bad either if he is taught to stand up for what he believes in!!! 
<br>
<br>Of coarse we live in America and women CAN'T stand any type of violence so I expect to here some white noise. OH, WELL!!
<br>
<br>We're men........ teach your son to be a man!!! Your wife might not like it but she will not like going to counseling appointments every 2 weeks with your son for years to solve some deep personality issues either. You can also teach him the way of the fox, to outsmart this kid, but it could lead to other outcomes. 
<br>
<br>I hate to hear this though, I would always stick up for the kids picked on, whatever happened to the kids that helped the bullied kids out??? Don't let your son become a passive, weak person though. Work with him! DO NOT FORCE FITTING ON HIM....... ONLY FOR SELF DEFENSE...................
