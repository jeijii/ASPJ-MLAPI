				I'm 50 and still in grade school! Figuratively speaking anyway.<br><br>There is a 33 year old guy at work. He is married with 2 young daughters and a complete db. He has no education or job skills. He works packing boxes in shipping. He goes on all night gambling runs, gang-bang orgies and ONS with both single and married women and lies to his wife about it. He brought a girl friend to the Christmas party and everyone knows he's married. He braigs about his expolits all the time, makes constant lued sexual jokes and inuendo and flirts with every girl in the office. He is a bully because he makes cruel jokes about the weaknesses of others to make himself look good. There is a wonderful, talented guy at work who is small because he has had diabetes since he was 3 which stunted his growth. This guy calls him 'quarta pollo', Spanish for 'quarter chicken' like you would buy in the supermarket. He dosen't respect himself or anyone else.<br><br>I know talking or lecturing, even advice as a friend will do no good. This is a small company with no HR department. He has manipulated everyone and he is fun so they put up with it. The bosses like him, but respect me and like me more, I believe.<br><br>This guy has been extremely rude and insulting to me in ways I can't begin to describe here. Maybe because he knows I don't fall for his **** or let him manipulate me. <br><br>My problem is this guy struts around like he owns the world. His motto is life is short so everything is done for self-gratification without responsibility or respect for others. He actually enjoys hurting other people. What can I do do make him grow up or at least stop acting like a db?
