				Im leaving the thread open for anyone who wants to share experiences of Gang Stalking as I've just read a similar post and it inspired me..It goes on everywhere and can be political or whatever<br><br>It does exist and it is almost impossible to discuss..it could be cultural groups, religious cults, criminal gangs etc. <br><br>If you are brave enough to share your experiences, please do. There is more documented about this in America than there is here in the UK
