				Massachusetts and Missouri, USA, have passed anti-bullying laws for public housing.  Is your state working on this issue?   Bullying/mobbing/harassment are huge problems in senior, disabled, and public housing in the United States.  It seriously affects not only people's housing options, it also can cause them mental and physical health problems.  I assume in other countries, but don't know for sure.
