Your nature and yeah, maybe small stature makes you a target, but hell, you should walk with pride, because you're a good person.<br><br>Every day you get bullied just think about how enjoyable it must be to live with so much hate inside of you as the bullies have. What a #######5 life choice eh?<br><br>In the end, you like you, that's all that matters, and that is huge. It feels GREAT to like yourself and know you're a good person inside and feel that every day.<br><br>That'll carry you far, even if (some of) the world hates it.<br><br>They can go suck lemons.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink">
