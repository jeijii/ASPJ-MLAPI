They are to blame, not you. You deserve to have a reasonable life and they deserve to know the consequences of their behaviour. <br><br>I could sit here and say "Poor you" and "that's terrible, hugs and love" but what's the point? Take back some of the control they removed from you and put the responsibility back at their feet.<br><br>What do you have to lose? They will either:<br><br>1/ Not respond. In this case they know that you blame them; that you are not going to accept their behaviour as reasonable.<br>2/ They react the same way as they did in school, in which case they have failed to grow and will go through life with the same level of misery which prompted their picking on you in school in the first place. In this case it will show that it's them, not you, that caused the behaviour.<br>3/ They will see that it's had a profound effect on you and it might prompt them to react appropriately.
