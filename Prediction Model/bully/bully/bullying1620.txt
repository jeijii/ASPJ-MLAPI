				Oh, O.K. This is a process to rescue my inner child. I am glad that I am healing myself.<br>I am good taking care of myself, hehe.<br><br>I was thinking one difference today.<br><br>When my twin sexually abused me, I confronted her soon after it happened and got angry at her. Then, I forgot the incident until my twin mentioned it the last year (after more than 20 years since it happened). When I go back to that moment of abuse in my mind, I still feel anger and annoyance. I feel my space (body) was invaded.<br><br>Meanwhile, I didn't remember my dad' sexual abuses until recently. I have never confronted him in my childhood. When I go back to that moment in my mind, I feel my body gets apart; my limbs get torn up. It's a pain. I feel he destroyed my body.<br><br>I wonder why I feel being 'invaded' in the case with my twin, and why I feel being 'destroyed' in the case with my dad.
