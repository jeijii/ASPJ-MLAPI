				Interesting..    so it's kind of like npd but it manifests after just one traumatic event rather than being a persistent personality state that's present before adulthood.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br><br>After reading the material, i'm inclined to view PTED as a subtype of PTSD.  <br>It presents in much the same way that traumatic incidents can cause manifestation of symptoms that mimic the PDs but cannot be PDs because the symptoms only started in adulthood.  <br><br>Usually you see the ''mimicking'' PDs variety of PTSD in people with a history of multiple trauma but i'm not surprised to read that one event can create a similar set of protective symptoms in a person.<br><br>Presumably this is only termed PTED if the symptoms start in adulthood rather than childhood and continue into adulthood.?
