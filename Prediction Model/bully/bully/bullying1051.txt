Also, I hope the victims of bullying are standing up for themselves now either by using fists or calling the police on them since teachers and principals don't want to do anything apparently.

The sports team seems to be the school's way of making a name for itself. I don't live in the US myself so I can't say for sure, but my impression is that it's difficult for a jock to really get into trouble for bullying. They simply get away with most of it, and that's messed up.
