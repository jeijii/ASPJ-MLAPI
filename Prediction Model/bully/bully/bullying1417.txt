				No, you are not at fault. They are certainly bullies from what you have written. Why do you have to tell them every thing about yourself like being transgender and all that? The more information you give the more scope they have to bully you. Don't you have even ONE friend to support you? Also remember that bullies feed on your reaction. Let them do their worst. Don't react. Ignore them or tolerate them whenever you can and they will soon get bored. Avoid begging. Don't give any importance to them. Above all, do not consider them your friends any more. At the same time don't antagonize them. Be passive. Best thing is to pretend to be unwell. If they ask you why you have changed you can simply tell them you are not feeling well. They will be unable to elicit any reaction from you and they will realise all their actions are being wasted and stop pestering you.
