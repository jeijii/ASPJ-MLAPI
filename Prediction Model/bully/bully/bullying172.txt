				This actually belongs in the PTSD forum, but my computer crashes whenever I go there. <br><br>I've heard of people who want to commit suicide, blow their finances, only to realize they are too cowardly to commit suicide. When I was a teenager, I would have laughed at this, but now that I'm older, I realize that it is a serious issue. People who want to commit suicide but are too afraid to should not be made fun of, but helped. <br><br>I am neutral when it comes to suicide. I'm not for it, and I'm not against it. However, something needs to be done about these suicidal people because I've seen many of these types of people. <br><br>When I was in school, I recall a video where suicidal people were interviewed, and at the end of the movie, none of them (there were ten of them) actually committed suicide. Also, when I was in prison (I'm not a real criminal, I was innocent), I saw inmates pretending to hurt themselves to gain attention, only they were too afraid to really harm themselves. <br><br>This would be comic if not for the real suffering that is going on. Unfortunately, many people laugh at this type of suffering. <br><br>I'm making this post to spread awareness of the issue. Whether or not suicide is a positive or negative thing is not the issue. The issue is in helping people who are too afraid to do it.
