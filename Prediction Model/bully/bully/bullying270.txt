				My boss is not very nice to his employees, and almost everybody, if not every single one of the 30-odd person staff has some sort of issue with him. A few of us have even come forward to the general manager with complaints. Ever since doing so, things have only gotten worse.<br><br>He is rude and verbally abusive towards the staff, and when you try to confront him he lies and denies, denies, denies. Just the other night he asked me point blank to do a task (scrub a sink- I am a cook in a kitchen so not an outlandish request). He then came by with 4 or 5 buckets of dirty soap water and sanitizer and dumped them into my clean sink. The conversation was as follows:<br><br>Me: (shocked, so I laughed) "What are you doing? I just cleaned that sink."<br>Him: "Why?"<br>Me: "Because you just told me to."<br>Him: "No I didn't."<br>Me: "Yes you did."<br>Him: "No, I didn't." (Pauses... I can see him thinking and he stutters as he responds) "What I... said... was... I just wanted you to know that... I had put some soap on the counter to let it set... and washing the counters would be the last thing we do at the end of the night before we leave."<br><br>At that point I was angry because I knew he was lying. Rather than simply accepting responsibility and simply saying "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to dump dirty water on your clean counter", he puts it on me. Essentially, it was my fault- because I heard him wrong. Which is entirely not true. I had been washing knives and he asked me me to scrub the sink when I was done with the knives.<br><br>And that's just one small example- literally a small example. I don't know what to do or how to handle him. I can't go to him or talk to him because I'm the one with the problem, I am the one who is wrong, he is the one who is right. He doesn't listen and as I said, he just lies and denies. GM and HR are already aware of the issues staff has with him, but yet he's still gainfully employed, so going above him does no good either... I don't know what to do.<br><br>I think the easiest answer is to find a new job, but that's just the thing. That's the easy answer. I'm not looking for a new job. I have invested too much into what I currently have to start over. I just don't know how to deal with a boss who doesn't value or respect me and who I feel bullies me. And this isn't just a personal feeling. I have had co-workers who see it, who come to me and ask me, "Why does he treat you that way? You know you don't deserve it."<br><br>*sigh*
