				Hi Lilyfairy,<br><br>You say you were bullied by your 'closest friends' for 2-3 years from the age of 16.  First of all, if they were bullying you, they were definitely 'not' friends.  You may have felt they were your friends, but it seems like they lead you into a false sense of security, so that you felt comfortable with them, and they they began to betray you.<br><br>Talking about things with someone you trust can help, but if the problem isn't easily fixable, counselling can just keep the problem going round in circles.  It can also keep you in a negative frame of mind.  If you find a counsellor who has a constructive plan of action to help you cope with or combat bullying, then ok, but most counsellors just talk the problem through.  As for a counsellor suggesting that YOU apologise to the bullies; that is ridiculous.  That is basically them laying the blame at your door.  You had nothing to apologise for.<br><br>Bullies 'feed' on gaining a reaction from the person who is being bullied.  The way to combat these people is to report the matter to as many people as possible.  If you keep it a secret, the bullies are winning.<br><br>Did the doctor know that the antidepressants made you aggressive?  If so they should have tried you on a different one.  <br><br>I have been through a similar experience, but I had the courage to report the incidents to the police, and the bullies were dealt with.  The feeling I got from knowing that these people could no longer ruin my life, made me feel so relieved.  The ring leader had to apologise to my face!  I have also been abused psychologically by someone who I saw as a good friend, who then spread gossip about me, and I no longer deal with that person.
