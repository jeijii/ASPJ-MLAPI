				Hello there, <br>My friends and I in TV production recently competed in a PSA involving the dangers of cyber bullying.  Our video exposes the real threat of cyber bullying on todays youth. With more and more teenagers becoming involved in social networking sites, many more see this as a cloak and continue to harass others until their breaking point. The winners of the cyber bullying receive a small scholarship to go towards college. My group and I would be forever thankful if you were to watch our video and kindly share it to others to get the word out about our short film and the dangers of cyber bullying. You can find the link here.<br><br><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAsI-rlZBFQ" rel="nofollow" onclick="this.target='_blank';">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAsI-rlZBFQ</a><!-- m -->
