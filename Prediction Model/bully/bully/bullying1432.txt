				i don't think they're saying just get over it.  maybe they're trying to say grow from it.
<br>
<br>do you think you're going to be a goth when you're 40?
<br>
<br>do you think your life is going to be stagnant and never change?
<br>
<br>when i was 20 i never thought i was going to be the age i'm now.
<br>
<br>and as far as other people suffering.  imagine being a child born into a 3rd world country.  your mom has hiv so you've inherited it from her.  but you may not live past your 5th birthday because most of your peers die before age 5 from things like diarrhea.
<br>
<br>i'm not trying to belittle the pain you're in now.  i'm trying to give you another way of looking at things.
<br>
<br>i've been where you're at now and i know it hurts bad.
<br>
<br>i hope you can grow quickly away from it.
