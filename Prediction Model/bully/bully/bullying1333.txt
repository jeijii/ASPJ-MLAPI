				She sounds like a complete loser and you need to put a stop to this sooner rather than later.<br><br>I have been on the end of bullying on and off in my life and in my experience bullies are pretty p*ss weak people and they seem to back off when you threaten them with Police or legal action...try this and see if she backs off.<br><br>Sel x<blockquote><div><cite>AnneFowley wrote:</cite>I am a target of a female bully (coworker) who happens to be twice my age (I'm early 20s)<br><br>She started off as a so called friend, but then with each following discussion she would say disrespectful things in a 'sweet' way.(this always occurred over the phone) I realized that the only reason this woman associated with me was because she disliked me or was jealous of me and she wanted to bring me down<br><br>Whenever she would call I would never pick up the phone..you'd think she would get the message that I didn't want to be bothered. No. then a few times she called from someone else's phone number. That's how she conned me into getting on the phone with her.<br><br>I eventually changed my phone number, and this must have angered her. In the beginning she gave me dirty looks..and when that didn't work, she started giving me 'sympathetic stares' everytime our eyes met. It still didn't work, and I never broke down and gave her my new number. <br><br>I notice she did light stalking..meaning whenever I was leaving work, and heading to the parking lot, she would ALWAYS be walking behind me.  She never followed me home in her car but she always managed to be behind me as I was heading to the parking lot. One day I caught her standing in a corner somewhere, waiting for me to walk out the building...she was on her cell phone talking, so outsiders wouldn't think her behavior was out of the normal...<br><br><br>After awhile, she started speaking to me again...She'd approach me and be sweet as pie (she would be very nasty on the phone but in person she is super sweet) every chance she got. She was trying to manipulate me into giving her my phone number again but I wouldn't budge. I didn't care how nice she was, I was trying to keep her at arm's length. She tried very hard, she'd give me the most sweetest greeting and in the sweetest voice...NOT falling for it. <br><br>she obviously jealous and has a huge insecurity.  I never had this type of intense bullying/stalking before. This is a first and it's kinda scary. I feel like I have no control over  my life. I really don't want this woman talking to me at all. She's crazy and a complete headcase. <br><br>I'm not sure what she feels that she is accomplishing by doing what she's doing. is she a lesbian bisexual? I mean I just dont understand teh purpose of another woman who keeps harassing/bullying someone else who has done absolutely nothing to them.</div></blockquote>
