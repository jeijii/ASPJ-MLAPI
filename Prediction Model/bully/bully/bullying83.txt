				Hello,<br><br>I can easily understand the terrible situation that you find yourself in, and I know that it seems like you are all at a dead-end.  On face-value, that is what anyone would see.  However, there is hope and there is a solution, or solutions.  I must admit thought that some solutions might not be agreeable to you.<br><br>Firstly, if she is to remain in the same school, then persistence on your part is needed.  I have learned in life that workers repeatedly fail to do any things that are outside of their adily routines, such as getting involved ina bullying case.  You have to pursue the issue, in effect 'harrassing' them enough so that they actually go out of their way to do what is needed.  Thus, I suggest maintaining pressure on the school and police to reach a resolution to this.  It is an important issue that is affecting the mental well-being of your child and your family.<br><br>I also suggest writing official letters to the school and carbon-copying them to the police and any other organisations in your are whose remit tis problem falls under.<br><br>The other option is to search for a new school and - possibly - to move out of the neighbourhood.<br><br>Take care<br>Kevin
