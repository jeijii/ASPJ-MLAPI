				<blockquote class="uncited"><div>my kid is more talkative than me but he also have simple nature...i fear he will be scared to tell us about any ill behavior in school...</div></blockquote><br><br>Would it not be a good idea then to regularly take him aside for a few minutes so as to encourage him to speak up to you whenever he might feel terribly affected by these kind of taunts?<br><br>My mother often used to sit with me after and even before school, talking about all kinds of stuff; oftentimes repeatedly emphasizing that she wanted me to dare to talk about whatever upsetted me.<br>Even if one day i'd turn out to feel homosexually oriented, she insisted that i'd tell her because she wanted to be able to understand what i was dealing with in my life.<br><br>After she established this regular routine of comforting me like that, and reassuring my faith in her willingness to understand any of the struggles i may have faced, for all the time to come afterwards, until the very present, i've always been feeling like i can bring up a whole lot which most other parents would have (un)wittingly disallowed their children from openly admitting due to the children having always adhered to a certain (unspoken) code of ethics, in which are contained the rules that determine what can and what cannot be discussed.<br><br>So let this hopefully serve as an inspiring anecdote for you.
