Based not on the select part I quoted, but your post in general, you seem overly needy, perhaps; maybe you are displaying borderline stalkish behaviours?<br><br>2. I think this is much more likely, she is a sick twisted emotional sadist. Telling you to be more passive and just take it? She may have been trying to weaken you and make you vulnerable, If you never stand up for yourself you will probably become more of a target. Perhaps she then thought you were more vulnerable than the rest of your friends and decided to covertly hurt you with exclusion. A narcissist that comes out smelling of roses? Seems at least plausible. If you are not careful how you word things to your friends, and keep on about it, they could easily be turned against you; after all who would suspect goodie two shoes? You had planned to go out with people already? You asked her to come.. somehow YOU were cut out, why would the friends who had FIRST been going with you cut you out? Seems like people are already being turned against you perhaps..<br><br>Look mate, her walking away on the attempted start of a conversation is extremely disrespectful, this is concrete 100%, regardless of if my other guesses are off. You already asked what you did wrong, that was enough.. asking anymore is disrespectful to YOURSELF and could be used against you if I'm right about the narc traits.<br><br>Blank her back. Hell, even if she starts trying to communicate then... DO NOT REENGAGE.
