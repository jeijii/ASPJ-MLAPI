If you think it's the type of workplace where bullies are swiftly dealt with, then by all means gather some evidence and report your concerns to an impartial manager. How many workplaces are like this though, compared to say...the number of workplaces where everyone turns a blind eye whilst a bully does whatever the hell they want. I think we all know the answer.<br><br>Good people should always be prepared to take a bully on aggressively. On an aside, that bully I dealt with was bullying far more than just me, and he literally bullies nobody now; I've taken over as head bully but I've never victimised a person in my life, and everyone is more relaxed. There is genuine truth to the claim that many bullies are cowards, but people who make this claim don't back it up by taking them on. They are cowards, but this means nothing if they're allowed to bully with impunity. It's everyone's responsibility to take them on.
