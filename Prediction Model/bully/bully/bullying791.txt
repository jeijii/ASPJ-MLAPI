				Ok, early days but no responses so far.<br><br>Another question that is bothering me. Am I at fault and complicit in any way?? I know now that's how bullies make you feel but could there be some truth in it? <br><br>-------------<br>I did mention 'potential work' being a part of this. Has that made anyone feel I have an underlying ulterior motive?? I don't and can explain.<br>This is a Pub. I have recently returned to the area and am well respected for past entertainment work there. I also have new valuable experience of running a pub myself.<br><br>As such I did have an interest in returning to my old part time job and also any other potential.<br><br>Bully has similar experience and ability. Being also in a dire financial situation he wants all of the work available. I can see how any reader might think I am just competing???? Not so &gt;&gt;<br><br>The bully had already managed to get feet under the mat and in some areas of the work available had better experience and qualifications. Already working there part time he was gradually moving into areas in which I had shown an interest to the boss.<br>Now THIS IS IMPORTANT. <span style="font-weight: bold">I had resigned myself to this</span>, knowing that as currently trusted by the owners he would always get first offer. So I had kinda forgotten about it and happy to concentrate elsewhere. No bad feelings cos i was not intending to usurp anyone.<br><br>Problem is of course that bully knows about this (some directly from myself being open with him) and feels threatened. I guess he has chosen to take action in his own way to secure his position --- BUT, doesn't realise he didn't need to!<br><br>The one curious thing is that the area of work he has now just acquired is 'entertainment' which is where my experience, track record at the venue and ability is actually far superior. Possibly directly to hurt me but I still keep an open mind. Here I have again been quite good because his work is tonight and I have stayed away again. I refuse to lower myself to bully level and go along to revel at his likely failure. (but to be honest my current anger did make it tempting). V pleased I didn't go.<br><br>------------------<br><br>Anyway -- bully is currently in control -- even if those being controlled don't realise it.<br><br>I <span style="font-weight: bold">don't</span> seek control. I <span style="font-weight: bold">don't</span> want to hurt anyone. I want to see resolution. What exactly is my next step because I have no idea at all!
