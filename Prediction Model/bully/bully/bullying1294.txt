				Hi Danae102<br>I understand how you feel. Actually, I wasn't bullied, I was the bully most of the time when I was in school, BUT, I understand your rage, not necessary your experience. <br><br>Why do I say that I understand you? Because when someone is angry, I instantly feel it, I connect with it, I'm drawn to it. Do you know who I don't pick on? people that fight back. Not because they scare me, it's because as a bully, I like to pick on the weak (yes condemn me to hell LOL). If someone has the balls to fight back, they prove to me that they're not a puss, I only pick on puss. Next time someone says something to you, say something back. flip them off. *mod edit*<br>You're a nurse, you're smart, I trust you will find a way around it. There's no point trying to be "the better person". What logic is that LOL? *mod edit*
