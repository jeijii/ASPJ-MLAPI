				Wow! I posted this thread 7 years ago!!<br><br>My advice to parents who have a child that's being bullied is to do whatever you can to protect your child. Take pictures, record your child talking about the incidents, talk to the school, to the teachers, ask for someone to be present with your child around the bully. Because these situations really do affect young children. How messed up is it, when one uncontrollable child lashes out on an innocent weaker child? Please don't take this matter easily. It's our job to assure safety and happiness for our children. <br><br>After I posted this original post about the bullying that happened when my son was barely 5 years old, I left that town and moved to a much better place with much better schools and thank God I saved my son.<br><br>An update on my son: He is 12 years old now and even though I believe the bullying negatively affected him, I think he has learned his own ways to avoid getting bullied. <br><br>He still doesn't fight back when someone bothers him but his friendly nature with people creates a circle of friends around him and usually someone will stick up for him and defend him against any possible bully.<br><br>It's a sad world we live in.
