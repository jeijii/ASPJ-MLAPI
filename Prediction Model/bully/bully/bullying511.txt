				As a slightly more than general idea - i think that it's a really good one. <br><br>I think that you've thought about this in quite a lot of detail already and am interested in hearing some more. <br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Therefore, what I propose is to form something which involves incidents of bullying being reported and they are investigated accordingly</div></blockquote><br>^^ this organisation that you propose would be the ones investigating and following up on everything - what kind of bullies are you talking of here..  are you looking at investigating all of them from the childs classroom up to the workplace or are you specifically looking at targeting a certain group..?   Maybe starting with a particular environment and then looking at expanding if things take off..?<br><br>The procedures if a bully is found out are difficult to work out.. you'd have to have the agreement of authorities or the voluntary participation of the bullies.. <br>Can I suggest a visit to your local police station or somewhere..? might be useful as a starting point for what you could do <br>xx
