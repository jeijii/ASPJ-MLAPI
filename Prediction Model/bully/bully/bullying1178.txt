				My boyfriend constantly gets angry/frustrated with me for things that I think are ridiculous.  He has gotten mad enough at me to yell at me or just ignore me 10 days out of the last 2 weeks.  I know the things he's mad about aren't reasonable, but I'm not sure if it qualifies as bullying.  It sure feels like bullying, but whenever I try to tell him to stop bullying me or being mean for no reason, he says that I'm offending him and then just ignores me for hours or days.  The times when he's not mad, he's really nice and fun to be around. I believe that he really does love me, but he's VERY immature for a 35 year old.  We live together, so I insisted that we go to counseling because neither of us wanted to break up but we didn't want to keep fighting either.  Like I said, when he's not mad he's the nicest guy ever, so he has the therapist pretty much fooled.  She always says we don't have problems so she doesn't understand why we fight.  Just so you understand how stupid the things are that he gets mad about, here are a few of them:<br><br>- I don't load/unload the dishwasher correctly<br>- I didn't want to have sex because I had a yeast infection<br>- I forgot to use the parking break when I parked his car<br>- I wanted to eat at a place that was "all the way across town" when he said I could pick wherever I wanted<br>- I was cleaning the house while he was trying to relax<br><br>It's just always stupid things like that, and I literally beg him to just let it go, but he never will, and he just gets angrier and angrier.  We actually had a discussion about all of our fighting yesterday, and he was treating me civilly, but when I recapped all the things I had "done wrong" yesterday in an attempt to illustrate how lame it sounds when they're all together, his reaction was just to say "Nobody's perfect."  I couldn't believe he still thought he was justified in the way he treated me.  <br><br>It's not just the anger either, a lot of the time when we're not even fighting he just says sarcastic or nasty things just to make me feel stupid.  When I try to tell him how it made me feel he just denies saying it at all or says I misinterpret everything.  He never ever takes responsibility for anything he's done, and he's only apologized a handful of times in the 2 years we've been together.  I find myself apologizing constantly in an attempt to get him to be nicer to me, but usually it doesn't work.  Whenever I tell him that the way he treats me makes me feel stupid or worthless or just bad, he says that I have problems and that they have nothing to do with him and then I need counseling.  But I've never felt like this with anyone else I've dated, and no one has ever treated me like this before, so I'm pretty sure he's the problem and not me.  What do you think????
