A vigorous reaction works in many cases, but looks like this kid you're describing is seriously messed up. Most people have limits and they give up when they see there's even the slightest threat of reaction. But this kid doesn't seem to hesitate to attack you even being considerably younger. That fact alone looks like a huge warning sign to me. He doesn't look like someone able to accept defeat on any level or circumstance. If he can't win alone, he'll call the thugs. Unfortunately, reasoning with him doesn't sound like a viable option either.<br><br>Can you think of someone else you know personally who could help you to come up with possible solutions? Perhaps even someone you're not used to talking with. Friend, family, neighbour, cousellor, I don't know. It's really a tough situation, so you'll need to work with details of your life/routine that we don't know about here.</div></blockquote><br>  Right now I cant ask for help cuz he hasnt done something like physical attack or smthing. Hes just disrespecting me. I got so depressed and sad now ,not because of him,but because i feel worthless that i cant handle a 15 years old. <br>And imagine i was having a great time before i met him 2day. Its almost funny how i get depressed after having a good time. Its like its meant for me to be sad.
