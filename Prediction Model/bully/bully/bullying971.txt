				I have a problem.<br>  The problem is I don't have respect around the hood by some individuals.<br>One of them is younger than me,much younger...15 or so. Every time we encounter down the street he says some thing,most usually "(my name) of (my mothers name)". Now I had the opportunity to slap him when he was much younger. But I never wanted to beat people.Just not in my nature. Now he's growing up. This can't keep going. I don't know how to act.<br>There are some options;<br>1.) Talk to him...Reason why I won't do that is because he is unreasonable.End of story.<br>  Let me tell you one episode i saw with him. He insulted someone from his mother. This some one grabbed him and slapped/punched/kicked him. Even he was getting hit he was smiling all the time. When he let him go ,after they separated some meters he insulted aagain. Again he beated him,and at last he insulted again and run away. Short, he is a motherfu*king kid.<br>2.) Beat him. he's about 4 years younger so u know how thats ending. But he is ,lets say guarded,by some real thugs. I mean those who know the police,have gunns,ex convicts. One word and they come. They'll see im older and propablly it will not end good for me. <br> But maybe he will think twice before saying a word on the street next time<br>    Just befor i wrote this,i was walking with my 2 new school friends. I saw him walking down the street ,i didnt know how to act,because i was ashamed if he called me something infront of my friends. So he looked and i made ,i would say stupid face to him. and he said what i didnt want him to say. It was so embarrasing ,so embarasing.<br>  Now should i beat him ???
