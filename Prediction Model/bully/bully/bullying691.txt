				you're probably right. I just don't know the right ways to interact with people, I couldn't really think of something entertaining to say. I'm usually alone and quiet for almost all of my life. For example during grade school, high school, or college I usually interact with people and generally enjoy for the first few years, but after a year or so I creep people out and they just detach themselves from me directly or indirectly. I've been diagnosed by a psychiatrist that I probably have avoidant personality disorder (he diagnosed me to have dysthmia a few years ago).

<br>Anyway, thanks for replying.

<br>she wasn't really asking for help, i guess she was trying to relax by finding humor in her mistake. I guess i don't really know how to help people, usually people don't ask me for help, for example for this year's fundraising event (a concert), they asked me to help with parking, lol.
<br>
<br>I usually don't laugh when i feel i can't help with something. I usually feel insecure and guilty about it. I usually try to laugh along with someone while we're talking alone and i almost never know any fun things to say.
<br>
<br>I'm guessing i looked very insecure and mean while laughing and my laugh was too loud or had a mean tone. (somehow i felt like writing lol after that) Why do I act like that?
