				ever heard of E.Q?  you said you were intelligent but lacked in other areas- well- an E.Q (Emotional Quota) is supposed to be a way to measure how you handle your emotional side of you. Like the way you react to ppl, whether you are tactful or an easily angered person that lashes out or if you are pretty imature for your age even though you are clever, etc. I think my E.Q is pretty #######5 even though my IQ is 146. i get upset and hurt very easily and angered like in a flash. i don't always know how to express my feelins even though i'm very articulate in other areas. weird.
