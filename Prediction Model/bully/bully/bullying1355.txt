				Hi, I'm new here. I am currently suffering severe anxiety having perceived bullying by my female boss. <br>I have now, eventually reported to my new line manager ,and the past year of walking on egg shells is taking its toll. I have been moved away from the bully's tasking area and given a new role. She remains in a management position with a new minion. <br>Before I started this job in May 2014 ,this woman told senior managers and the woman who was going to be my line manager that I created a toxic environment when we worked together 14 years ago and that I was promoted because I was having a extra marital relationship at work. She told the senior managers that she would give me a wide berth. <br>I started there, don't really remember her because we were on different teams. She then engineered to be both my line  manager and tasking manager.<br>I found out about the character assaination and challenged her, she apologised so I let it go. BAD MOVE.<br>Snce then, she has insulted another female and had to apologise <br>Failed to recognise my achievements and ideas  but gave credit to someone else. When challenged told me she gave my praise verbally <br>Erased my name from meeting minutes<br>Told me constantly that I was struggling with the role, but gave me vague instructions <br>Brain dumped in emails that I struggled to understand, then questioned my competence <br>Changed my work without telling me why<br>Gave me difficult deadlines but had to give me credit when I achieved them, because another member of staff recommended me for a bonus <br>Constantly told me that at my grade she expected this that and the other inferring I was not doing my job<br>Pitted me against another staff member and lied to my new line manager about a meeting outcome where I was blamed. She wouldn't give me the minutes but  When I got them from another source, I was not blamed. <br>Failed to give me eye contact when I said hello ...silent treatment <br>Made spiteful comments about other managers in front of me <br>Rubbished everyone else's work <br>I have been moved after reporting it, but have terrible anxiety, having heart palpitations, IBS heart shakes etc  and am terrified she will step up the campaign. <br>I am trying to find another job because I fear she will get away with it but my confidence and self esteem are on the floor. <br>When she was told I was being moved away for the sake of my health her response was..what am I going to do for a resource now? She said she was upset because she had invested so much time in me. Not one question about whether I was okay. <br>How will I re build my confidence and self esteem? <br>Sorry for the long post and sorry if it's rambling ..grateful for any advice . I feel like I'm dealing with a monster..and I'm trying to understand why I put up with it for so long, and why I didn't stand up for myself.
