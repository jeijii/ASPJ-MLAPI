				Hello, rubydu22 and welcome to the forum. What you are going through is normal. Being bullied and talked about like that can leave you very traumatized. You are not responsable for what those people did to you or for the state you are in. I think you can't hang out becouse you are afraid that you will hear someone talking about you again and you are very sensitive about it. That is understandable and you don't have to do anything that you are not comfortable with. 
<br>It's good that you left that toxic environment. Now you have a chance to change your life and to get better, with time. You self harmed to gain some controll over the situation and to release the pain and pressure, I think. We have a self harm forum as well and you are welcome to post there too. I'm sorry you went through this. No one should and it is serious and important. It's possible to be afraid of going out or hanging out with people when you have been bullied like this. But if you are patient with yourself and talk about it, you can get better.
<br>I understand that writing this has been hard for you, but you can talk to us more and at any time you feel like it.
