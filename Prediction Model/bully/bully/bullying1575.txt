				Dear Moscato:<br><br>Your post reads very reasonable and trustworthy to me, as portraying the situation and your boss as he is. I suppose he feels that if he admits wrongdoing he will lose your and other employees' respect. And for him, respect means fearing him and being motivated to obey him with no complaints, no matter what.<br><br>I don't think there is anything you can do to change the way he operated (that would have been nice). Since you want to keep your job, accept that this is how he is and expect him to continue to behave this way. Do not be surprised unless... one unimaginable day he admits a wrongdoing on his part- be surprised then. <br><br>atina
