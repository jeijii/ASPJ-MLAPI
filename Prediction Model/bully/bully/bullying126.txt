				Sorry, but there were so many red flags in your very first conversations with him that I think you may need to seek therapy just to figure out why the heck you ever went to see this guy in person at all! He TOLD you he was a really messed up jerk who had no intention of treating you with any inkling of respect... Ditch him! This whole post reads like the part in the horror movies where they always go up the stairs, or into the basement instead of out the front door to the car.... There ARE good guys out there. Even if there weren't, being single is great compared to wasting your life with an A-hole like that guy. You don't need him. At all. <br><br>You are lucky that he didn't kill you and leave you in a dumpster in an alley somewhere! Block him, and for gods sake, stop texting him, or crying over him, this guy is a psycho! RUN! <br><br>Might I add, that it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a restraining order against him or whatever the equivalent would be in your country.
