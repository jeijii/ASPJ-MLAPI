				First of all make sure you are removed of all as much as you can bullying.  There needs to be memory and processing of bullying.  There shouldn't be toxic people that bully that you keep in your life.  In situations were it matters to deal with it to be okay in yourself because you need to make a living you have to know how to keep yourself safe from any triggering to the past.  Lastly, if it lives inside yourself as is separate then come to terms with it as much as you can so that there isn't a bunch of system fighting indecision and worry based on the past and how the trend of people are. It is not your fault either.  It is ok to be when safe enough dealing with it.  Don't allow anyone to blame you for dealing with it later for taking the christian way out ignoring praying for your enemies only, that is what you are suppose to do but not only.  The passive amnesic aspect isn't your fault let there be a plan to remove anxiety/panic to fight for yourself.  I think gradually you will notice that you are less charged by those emotions of trauma of bullying.
