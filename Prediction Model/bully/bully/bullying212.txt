Bullying in and of itself is not something I enjoy, but I imagine it within the context of someone being concerned or just playing around trying to make me into a better person, maybe like a big sister would do to her little sister. I miss those kinds of relationships, because I feel like they insulated me from those harsh words children inflicted upon me when I was a kid (and as an adult, too). I've been told that I shouldn't have such masochistic desires, but doesn't it make sense, it does to me, to want something to become less scary and less scaring? When I was a child, none of my classmates who teased me really played with me. They went for my emotional main arteries and sliced right through them. They teased me until I felt anger and strong self-loathing and didn't really care how I felt about the situation. I did make one friend outside of school, though, who did tease me playfully, and maybe I got this desire from him. I also started watching a TV show where teasing other people because of the way they look was made to look normal and even inviting. I laughed along with him as I watched it. I was super sensitive at the time and didn't really know how to react to anything, but gradually I started to enjoy it. Now that I'm a 30 year-old woman, I still find my mind seeking it out. Part of my desire is just wanting to "win" socially, to show people I can take a joke, even to show people I might be able to make some of my own. <br><br>I was also diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder a few months ago, so if this seems like odd social behavior, maybe that's why.</div></blockquote><br><br>Back to your original post.  To sum up my thoughts to you.  Yes, some people are just plain mean people and it's important to see them for who they are, mean people.  I hope you find nice and good people who are genuine in your life.  Wishing you the best.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile">
