I felt bullied by my mom as a teen and when she would treat me bad, I did feel I deserved it.  Like I felt glad I was getting what I felt, at that time, was what I deserved.  Bullying messes with your mind.  I am not sure if my abuse was mild or not because I cannot compare it to others similar abuse, but it is hard for me to believe and sometimes to even trust another person completely.  Every time a good friends hurts me in some way, I withdraw and it becomes hard to trust again.  But I do trust again, it just takes me time and I feel I have matured as a person because of my "lessons" (as I'll call them) in life.  I have a lot of friends.  I feel blessed.
