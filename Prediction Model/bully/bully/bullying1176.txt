				It's not a good idea to make up threats you don't plan to carry out like setting a bullies house on fire and shooting their family. First of all let make note of the fact that John Gotti's family may not have been subjected to a lot of bullying as children, but quite a few of them ended being buried as landfill with lots of bullet holes in them.  The more you depend on extreme intimidation to control the behavior of other people the more people are going to regard you as a serious threat to their survival which they will try to eliminate whenever they get the opportunity. There's no point in being afraid of somebody like Hitler or Osama Bin Ladin whom you believe is a maniac who's probably going murder you someday no matter what you do. We all have a right to self-defense. My old man was a Marine D.I. who taught me never to point a gun at anybody if you didn't plan to use it. It undermines your credibility if you make phony threats and makes you more at risk of becoming a target for preemptive attacks, <br><br>I had some kids bullying me back in high school. I brought a dead cat I found to school in my lunch bag. The word got around about that very fast and nobody ever bullied me again. No threats were made. It wasn't necessary for me to say a word. There was nothing anybody could have filed legal charges on me for doing either, let me add, unlike threatening to murder somebody's family.<br><br>My niece recently had the teenage brother of a friend of hers threaten her with a gun. She told her mother and older sister. They went to see the boy's family. The kid said the gun wasn't loaded, the <br>mother blew it off as a joke, and said the boy's father the gun belonged to who lived in a separate apartment was asleep and my sister couldn't talk to him. Hitting that stone wall, she simply reported the matter to the Dallas Police who put out an arrest warrant for the kid on a 2nd degree felony.
