				Training and counseling and time..  You need help,  you need to talk to someone about this and learn a new way to live.  Notice I didn't bring up the bully.  The problems is, you live in a situation with bullies, If you continue to do so, you will have to gain outside help to learn how to deal with them correctly. Most bullies back down to authority.  They believe they can get away with stuff. .  You will have to bring those authorities in..  I would suggest a counsellor to start the process.  If you do nothing, nothing will change.. <br><br>This is all horrific and humiliating, However, no one will rescue you. You will have to be willing to go forward and start the process for change.
