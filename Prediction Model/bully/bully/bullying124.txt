				Some teachers have their favorites, and their not-so-favorites. It´s creepy. It´s creepier if they agree with bullies. No, I´m wrong. It´s just creepy. They want to have silence and obedience in the classroom above everything, or just dislike someone, although they are good kids in their own way. I have seen pupils suffer from that in high school. If you do extra work with a pupil who has problems with some work it will create the strongest of bonds. <br><br>Okay, this is painful. Actually I´m pissed off as !"'#%(" In kindergarten they said my son had autistic traits. When the !"$#$$&amp;#$ school heard about it, they acted like he wasn´t able to learn anything, just murmering about the `group process´ of the Waldorf school bladiebla, and how he would not create a problem for themself. In his new school he has the highest grades. I´m pissed off with myself that I have let him go there. It´s like they made a deal not to say anything positive about him so that I would ´get the message,´ at best. Not even did they do this with my son, because of social anxiety, after a month someone started wondering whether I could also have a psychological problem. So they gave me weird stupid looks, and when I talked to them, they acted like therapists for real, very officially shaking my hand and stuff.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br><br>Also, I feel like bullies are getting the best places in society nowadays and things work in many workplaces the same way as in school. Like, I was working somewhere for only one day and because I had social anxiety they went to the boss and made something stupid out of it, like `you are not sociable´ or ´you don´t look empathetic.´ I mean, going to the boss and not even trying to make it work isn´t even sociable in itself, ###$ off...
