				From what I can see, your boss is not easily satisfied, whatever you do. He seems to enjoy belittling you.  You could go to your Personnel Department and have a word with someone.  As this bloke is your boss, treading carefully is well advised.  You are obviously too efficient, and he doesn't like it.  Does he treat anyone else in this manner?  I think you need to keep your relationship with your boss on a professional level, as befriending him is just going to let him abuse you all the more.  I would definitely seek advise from the Personnel Department, and if you get no joy, you really have to decide whether your job is worth the humiliation.
