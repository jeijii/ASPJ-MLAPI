				I get bullied about my weight too.  I'm only 4'11" but weigh 238.  Too fat, I know.  Trying to lose weight.<br>I ride public transportation and I hear names like "fat a** b***h" constantly.  One nice mouthy young lady whacked me over the head with a schoolbook bc she didn't like something I said (i.e. eavesdropping) and said "why don't you take a bike to work or better yet walk?  You could sure use the exercise."  The whole bus roared in laughter (including the driver).  Another man said I was so fat I took up two seats.  I do NOT.  Again the bus roared in laughter.  Yet I see people riding the bus who do indeed take up two seats because of their obesity, and nobody dares to insult them.  Makes me sick.<br><br>People who make such comments reveal how nasty they are.  They probably have miserable lives so they want to bully ppl they deem vulnerable. <br>The next time someone makes a fat comment, I might just tell them I'm a female sumo wrestler in training. LOL
