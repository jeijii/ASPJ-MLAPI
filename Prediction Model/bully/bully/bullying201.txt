				I was always the tallest person in my class, a graduating class of 995, so yeah I was tall, I am tall.
<br>
<br>I was always picked on until I was in 9th grade, hundreds and hundreds of times, because I was the tallest and didn't fight.
<br>
<br>Then one day I did.  From age 14-23, 13 fights, all in self defense.  Every person I hit I maimed.  Yes, that is right.  The blazing anger and rage that all that picking caused in me brought into the open.
<br>
<br>Then I became the bully, wispered reputation.  I didn't care.  Nobody that ever heard or saw me hit someone ever messed with me.  Good enough, better then getting beat 2-3 times a day.
<br>
<br>Good luck working yours out,
<br>W
