				So i changed job recently after running away from abuse at work (pemanent devaluation, trying to create tensions between people, isolating me, impossible goals, no structure, etc.)<br><br>Recently during group walk i talked with a lady who had burnout. I was surprised how our stories were similar. She didn't work from one year, but looks tired and depressed. She was devalued all the time. All what she did was wrong. She was very invested person. She had good results, good relations with people, honest.<br>After the break, he tried to force meeting. He lied to meet her. He pretended that he hadn't received important documents. My manager did the same. Force meeting. I didn't want, she neither. I didn't want - and don't want ever to see those benevolent eyes and this cold quietness trying to force contact. <br><br>It takes time to recover energy. It takes time to recover internal love. I didn't imagine that.<br><br>It was only one year. Only one person. Only job. How is it for people who have such parents?
