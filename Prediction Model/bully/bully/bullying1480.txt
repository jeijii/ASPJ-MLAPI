				I would like to thank my former school bullies. In trying to bring me down all those years ago, they unwittingly gave me a purpose in life, which is to advocate for the victims of today and write a book, telling the story of how I was relentlessly bullied during school, the changes it forced me to go through, and the decisions, good or bad, that I made as a means to end my own suffering. <br><br>I would also like to thank them for making me that much stronger and unwillingly teaching me the value of empathy, kindness toward others, personal boundaries and love of self! It gets better...much better! You are worth fighting for! You are worth LIVING for!<br><br>*mod edit*
