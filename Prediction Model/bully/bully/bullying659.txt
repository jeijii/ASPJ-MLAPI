				Good morning,<br>this is my first post here so please go easy!<br>First some background information regarding my question<br>At my company we have an Christmas party this year there was drug use by colleagues which I mentioned to another employee who took it upon themselves to raise this with management. A couple of weeks go by and the drug user (Employee A for reference) thinks its my collegue (employee B) who had informed management after a couple of days employee B told employee A that it was myself who made the complaint (which is not true!) employee A and I delete/block each other on social media I then remove employee B.<br> Employee B comes into my office and says the following "Not only are you spineless you are hilarious" to which I had no response as I was dumbfounded! A day or so goes by, employee A and his Mrs start sending messages over social media to my wife (not nice messages..) not a massive problem as she fights more corner and blocks them both.<br>At this point, I raised this all with management, we have 3 on site directors I told them all separately 1 off said its bullying 1 off said he will sort it (happens to be employee A's brother) and the main one also says he will sort it (hes more of the HR guy)<br>I am ignored by both employee A and B and employee A tells everyone on the shop floor about this, so there is of course an atmosphere around me<br>Employee B continually messes with my blinds nothing major but annoying, telling me "this blind has never been shut get it right" this happens daily<br>On Monday morning, I am one of the first in I came in to find a message written on one of the computers saying "Adam chats lies, prick!" I take a photo and raise this with management after a long chat my manager assurs my that in a couple of days he will of sorted it, by this he pulls me employee A and B into a meeting and says he does not want to hear any more of it and thats all the action taken, I am almost in disbelief that none of the issues are spoken about or A and B spoken to about any of it.. swept under the carpet so to speak (this has happened twice before when complaints have been made, both employees were "let go" with a payoff) <br>Today, I come in and say good morning to employee C who responds with "F*** O** donâ€™t talk to me" which makes a part of my job near on impossible!<br>All of this has been getting on top of me recently, I have an almost 3 month old baby (my first) and a wife chomping at the bit to come into work and shout people down! She has also been diagnosed with PND which is of course a nightmare for all. I am now feeling rather down and depressed as I feel like I am the bad person. it has led me to return to self harming to help cope with everything going on (I am probably being over sensitive)<br>So my question is, does this constitute bullying? or am I just being sensitive?<br>also, apologies for grammatical errors<br><br>Thanks
