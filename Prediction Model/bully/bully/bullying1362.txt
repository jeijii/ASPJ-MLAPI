				Hello, <br><br>I am new here. I have a boyfriend who I strongly suspect has Aspergers, although he has not been diagnosed. I have worked with people with Aspergers and I see similar patterns regarding social behaviour. I am going to post this in the Aspergers forum and in this forum too because I want to find out if I am being bullied or not. If I am , it is not very severe bullying but it would be useful to know if it is my issue or someone else's. <br><br>I want to ask what to do about his criticism of me. <br><br>In an argument, he will say things like 'You are a stubborn person.' 'You live in a dream world' 'I have the ability to deal with this issue but YOU don't." "YOU are not emotionally mature", "You can't handle conflict" "You are selfish." etc. There has been many different examples over the years and I have forgotten some of them. <br><br>He says these things in an argument situation, and often when his voice is slightly raised, and he often empahsizes the YOU. <br><br>I often get very upset, and I try to tell him that it is not a nice way of saying these things to me. I feel like I am being bullied. If I say this in the argument he will say 'but it's the TRUTH' and often goes on to say 'YOU can't handle the truth.' <br><br>He thinks it is normal to talk to someone like that, whereas I would not dream of talking to someone like that unless I was deliberately trying to hurt them. I am English, which might be a reason for my reticence to be direct with someone, but he is English too...<br><br>This has been going on so long, I feel that I have lost connection with myself and what is normal. <br>Am I going mad, or is this a normal way to behave. Do I have to 'toughen up?' in order to be with him?<br><br>I told him I wanted to find out whether this was normal or not, and he said that was another way of me trying to evade the fact I need to deal with the fact I can't take criticism without seeing it as a malicious attack. He might be right, or he might be being manipulative and trying to isolate me further from my instincts that something is not right. He appears manipulative, I am not actually sure whether he is or he just has a very different way of seeing the world than me. <br><br>He is getting very upset that I 'keep calling him an asshole'. Of course I have never said he is an 'asshole', I have just tried to make him understand his words are often unkind. <br><br>I am really willing to work on my faults, and I am quite an avid self improver. On the odd occasion he has said something in a constructive way, I have mainly listened. I can probably improve on working on my faults though, and I will do. I find it very hard to take them though if they are said like 'YOU ARE THIS.' <br><br>I am posting this as I really need some advice on whether this is my issue or not, or whether he is in fact being nasty, and if he is, how do I explain to him that he could phrase things differently.
