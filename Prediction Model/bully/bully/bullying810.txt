				I'm afraid I've been through the same thing, to the point I did slash my arms. My parents wouldn't give me a break at home, my classmates wouldn't give me one at school, and it wasn't until 9th grade that I finally accepted my place as the joker, which is when they really started liking me. And, it turns out, despite them being giant dicks, they deeply regretted it, mainly because they didn't know any better. Doesn't help NOW, though, I have Dissociative Identity Disorder, a hard-to-spell mental disease brought on by years of that kind of stress still going on. You learn to cope. It takes time.<br><br>But if you want to talk to someone about it, feel free to PM me. I'll listen.
