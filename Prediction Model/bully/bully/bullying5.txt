				I had a word account that was hacked through the email. It was being scanned by people who were bullying me and based on what I wrote, they used it to plan and 'sneak' suggestions to people who were around me if I wrote anything that pissed them off or I had plans to do something positive. They keep an eye on my debts through their connections and they 'don't want me getting away with anything', and yet they splash out and blow thousands of dollars in a weekend and don't give a $#%^ how much money they waste.<br><br>Another thing, my degree was sabotaged by someone on my Live journal friends list years ago, He knew where I was studying and stole my folio and became a freelancer based on what I'd learnt, he exploited my work and now there are rich young people who want to sue me and they all think I did it to myself.
