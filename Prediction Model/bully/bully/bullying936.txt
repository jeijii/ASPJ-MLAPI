				Hello this is my first post here and i probable could've waited till the morning but i just cant take it off my mind.<br>I have been friends with this guy coming up to five years now and we got along fine but now over the past few years he's been calling me names, have digs at my looks and pointing out my insecurities. <br>He starts making comments about my hair as if im losing it, he took a photo and posted it on a group chat. One morning he banged on my door and asked what would i prefer to be called a bear or a bald eagle which i asked my is he calling me a bald eagle which he replied with cos you're losing your hair. I told him tostop calling me those names which he then asked 'or what?' I was upset with what he had done and said so i confronted him on multiple occasions but he says its only banter. The following day he said sorry but said he felt bad which i didnt think it was much of an apology cos he wasn't sorry for what he said or did but only apologiezed becuase it affected his mood. He was then all nice to me, offering lifts to the shops and dropping me off home which i thought he was sorry but now i only think he was sorry because he needed to use my camera equipment for covering a show which i did lend him before i started thinking about what happened. I talk to my sister about things like this but without my knowlege she went and confronted him during a convention he covers about it. Today i had an arguement with the guy who came in asking me is there a problem. I told him how i felt about the whole thing and what i think but he replied saying i cant take a joke and i use and abuse people because i havn't given him money for fuel '(I used to pay for his lunch on the journey untill he was going the same way i was so since i wasnt asking him to go out of his way and was just tagging along i thought it would be unfair). He hasnt taken any responsibilites for what he said and done and now he's twisted the whole thing on me, making it outas if im the bad guy and hes the victim and now i cant get over hisaccusation of me and i just dont feel great about the whole thing now. I feel as if i am a nasty person now for accusing him for bullying and only being nice to get what he wants but i then think of his actions and right now i dont know what to think of<br><br>Did i overreact or am i justified? I really need to know cos i cant get any rest because of this and i cant stop thinking about it and im starting to feel worse by the minute  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad">
