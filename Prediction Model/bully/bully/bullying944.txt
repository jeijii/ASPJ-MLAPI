				In most cases, I think bullying is worse when the victim is a child. Mistreatment of any kind during the years when a child is developing psychologically and socially can have disastrous effects. I'm living proof of that. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Arkx6 wrote:</cite>As an adult was bullied was much worse...ended up abusing light drugs and developed some symptoms of anti social personality disorder...</div></blockquote><br><br>Being bullied as an adult can be even more devastating if you were bullied as a child as well. In my case, the bullying stopped by High School, but if it had continued on through those years and on into adulthood, I can honestly say I wouldn't be here right now.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>seabreezeblue wrote:</cite>The anti-bullying campaign hasn't really helped - the poster looks good on the school wall and the school can say ''oh, we're good aren't we?''  - but the truth is that children are still being bullied each and every day...</div></blockquote><br><br>And they will always be. There will always be bullies--both child and adult. Children are cruel. I would say every child has been bullied to some extent in their life. It is, unfortunately, a rite of passage. It's part of social nature. There will always be people who get what they want and/or express their inner fears through intimidation and violence. You can't stop children from bullying any more than you can stop them from sharing their lunches. It happens, and no one will ever be able to monitor every moment of a child's interaction with others. I'm not saying anti-bullying campaigns aren't a good thing, but anti-bullying techniques are difficult to enforce. No child wants to be isolated and singled out as a victim of bullying. In many cases that could make things worse. As for bullies, you can't change a child's nature. You can do what you can to correct his/her behavior, but if a child has a need to bully, he or she will do it. In some situations, such as if a child is a bully because he/she is being abused at home, things can be done about it.
