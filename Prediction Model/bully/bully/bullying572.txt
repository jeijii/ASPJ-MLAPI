				I weigh somewhere around possibly over 250lbs on a 5’11 frame and realize that I could stand to lose a few pounds (understatement) it’s a work in process I’m eating healthier and exercising more, but I am often treated like the “fattest person in the world” when there are people 500lbs and well over it who have layers of fat on top of layers of fat etc. Just really don’t get why these people are somehow invisible and left alone but yet I’m made to feel like the center attraction at the park zoo because of my weight. I also can’t even eat a salad in public without being gawked at and hearing someone whispering about my weight but yet a 400lb guy can eat three double cheeseburgers and no one says a thing to, about or within ear shot of him.
