				I have been stalked many times. The first time was when I made a minor comment about the holocaust, and some jewish guys (or at least I think they were jewish; either that, or they were just a bunch of white guys sucking up to political correctness) threatened to gang up on me. <br><br>Another time, someone made an illegal phone call to someone else in an attempt to frame me. Fortunately, I was in a room with six witnesses at the time that it happened, so I had an alibi. Unfortunately, my own family didn't believe me, and they've hated me ever since. That's fine. I hate them right back. <br><br>Another time, I made some comments about black people, and strangers started calling me up on my phone in the middle of the night. I reported this to the police. They didn't give a damn. <br><br>I don't take that much offense to these events because it's cowardly to attack someone en masse. Are they really so afraid of me that they need to gang up on me instead of facing me one on one?
