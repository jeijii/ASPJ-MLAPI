				I can honestly say for me, my wound didn't begin to heal until I found a good therapist trained in bullying that has helped.  Please seek it out because there is a way to get over it and heal, but some of the things you won't see on your own.  Since yesterday, I've been seeing a lot more and now I get to deal with the aftermath.  It's okay because it gets me one step closer to being healthy again.
