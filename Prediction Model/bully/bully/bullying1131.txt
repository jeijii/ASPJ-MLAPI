				I can imagine why that would bother you, jellybean.  If it were me, the problem would not so much be the "being ignored", but the "not knowing why".  I'd try talking to one of her close friends, if possible, in a joking sort of way.  "Oh, I messaged X on facebook, but she didn't reply, do you think she's accidentally unfriended me?"  I'm afraid I don't know the exact facebook terminology for blocking people, elsewhere online it was a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bozo%20filter" class="postlink" rel="nofollow" onclick="this.target='_blank';">bozo filter</a>.<br><br>That way you aren't interfering with her sainthood, and you're implying it's all a mistake or misunderstanding. Which seems unlikely, given how long it's been going on, and across texts, email and in person.  But it's a way for her to save face, if she wants to be friends in the future.  She's unlikely to be blanking you without having mentioned the reason to someone else.  If the other person you ask doesn't know, then you could try leveraging this person's reputation for niceness, since if she HASN'T discussed it, perhaps she doesn't want people to know that she can be mean too.  So ask this person to ask her directly.  <br><br>The chances are, if you can't think of an obvious reason for her to be doing this, that it is nothing at all to do with you.  And that even if you can't get to the bottom of it, she's the worst person in the world, not you.  It might be something as difficult for her to admit as that she's jealous of you for some reason [fitness, academic achievement, relaxed attitude to life, strength under pressure, her boyfriend said he thought you were attractive] and none of that is stuff you can fix for her or change about yourself.  In which case, TROJAN's advice is the best there is.
