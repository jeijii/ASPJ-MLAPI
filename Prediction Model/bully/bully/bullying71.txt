				Does close people calling you "a liar" when they know you are telling the truth which hurts you count as bullying?Or am I too sensitive?I mean,i would still love them if it was,but I'm kind of feeling guilty because i'm always trying not to get offended from this type of behaviors,but it always makes me sad.So If it was considered bullying,i wouldn't feel that much bad.(I didn't shout at them or use bad words...I just tried to defend myself being truthful).
