				I am a 24 year old vietnamese american man and I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Since 2010 I have been bullied on another site constantly by a large group number of people. I tried reporting it to the internet providers but they won't do anything about it. I get attacked in the travel vietnam section of that site and these two trolls on there has framed me for being an troll when I am not. They are making sock puppet accounts impersonating me. I am engaged to my vietnamese girlfriend in vietnam and I get attacked every time I ask a question about her. Most of the questions are harmless questions like asking where to find a good resort to have my wedding reception at or how much would wedding expenses cost in vietnam. They framed me for being a troll and have repeatedly impersonated me for the past 6 years. The website recently gave level 7 users the ability to move questions to other categories and they have been moving my questions to the mental health section on there. They said in the past that they hate me because I am mentally ill. They also said that they think that my fiancee doesn't exist and thinks that I am delusional. I know my fiancee exist and that she is real. I don't know where to go to find out some information I need in order to get married in vietnam. They think that no woman in vietnam will marry me when I already got engaged. I tried not to let them get to me but it makes me feel so depressed and upset when I see posts they make on there trying to get others turn against me. I don't know what to do anymore because everyone on there thinks that I am troll now because of them framing me. Is there anything I can do ? I feel so depressed and suicidal because I have been bullied throughout school and I can't believe it is still happening when I am an adult.
