				First off good job becoming an accountant, that alone is a feat of it's own. It is not easy and I am sure you are great at it. Otherwise why would so many people think you are arrogant or a show off?<br>Obviously they view you as a threat or as better than them, and how do most people act when they meet someone like you that is qualified and good at their job? Well that depends on how your professional personality is.  As I read your post and knowing from what I have seen with my own experiences in the business world, I figured you were like me when it came to being a professional. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Akryse wrote:</cite> I am not a loud and boisterous and condescending, but polite, quiet and meek to the point of submissiveness. I always say yes to everything and go to ridiculous lengths to try and be liked, because I am terrified of upsetting anyone and not becoming successful at work </div></blockquote><br><br>And you are just like me. Or how I used to be. I figured you were like this because of how they were treating you. And honestly everyone around you, the loud, obnoxious, get in their bosses faces, who you swear will get fired for the things they do, move up and get promotions.<br><br>Example. They had to chose someone to switch shifts at my old job in the medical field. The HR guy showed me my file, I had two sheets,one time I had surgery and the other I was sick with the flu. He then showed me a stack of folders, all stuffed with sheets that were call-ins, reprimands, tardiness records, etc. And even he said I shouldn't be the one forced onto another shift. However, in the end they all threw fits and yelled and cussed and ultimately got away with it. I was the one switched to the crappy hours. That is what made me realize it's all politics of who you know, and if you make yourself a target or victim they will feed on you and take advantage of you. <br><br>Now what can you do about this? Fight back and become one of them? Might be too risky, you might be the one they make an example of and fire. For me personally I just stuck in there, I got to know them all better, and I still was nice and did my job to the best of my ability. And I don't really make mistakes. However, I also spoke my mind. If I felt like someone was trying to "throw me under the bus" to cover their own ass, or was saying I did something wrong that I know I didn't. Then you better believe I will speak up and tell them that I don't agree with them and why. On the other hand if I did in fact screw up, I will own up to it and promise to do better.<br><br>For you and where you are now. I would do the training so you don't lose your job. I would then come back and do the job to the best of my ability. I would not act submissive however, come in confident and stay that way. Get to know your co-workers better any way you can, so they know you are not arrogant, you are just good at your job. And if they still try to bully you, call them out on it, ask them why they think you are that way and crack jokes if you can. I'm sure half my co-workers think I'm crazy, but hey, they respect me and they know I don't like mess-ups or screw around. And this is the same place "my best co-worker friend" used to "accidently" bump into me aggressively or shake her hand at me when she wanted me to hand her something, etc. I just showed her I wasn't a push over either. And I still don't exactly like her, but I am professional and treat everyone on that level. <br><br>It takes time, and as long as you can't get fired like last time, then you should be ok. Just hang in there. Get to know them better and show them that you are a cool person. Be less quiet, I know it's not easy if you are usually quiet but they have got to get to know you somehow. Show them you can be alpha and that they are not going to walk all over you. <br><br>Just don't do anything stupid that might get you fired. I honestly don't know your exact work situation, but I have seen a lot in the corporate world and it's really the strongest survive and the weak stay where they are at and don't move up. It sucks for people like you and I, but we have to survive. <br><br>Don't know if any of this helps, hard to type out all of my thoughts, would be better spoken, or if I could magically be there to help you during live action events. Good luck, and if you have any questions feel free to ask.
