				Littlesam, I am sorry to hear of what you went though.  I can relate somewhat.  When I was young I was bullied because I was short, wore glasses and had a slight speech impediment.  My freshman year in high school the boys all made up a name for me.  They called me Sid.  That's not my name and I don't know why they called me that but everyone laughed.  One day I read something out loud that had Sid in it and the whole class started laughing.  The teacher asked why everyone was laughing and someone said they called me Sid.  I tried to smile and make a joke but my teacher could tell I was hurt.  Later years I was called #######1 and pushed into lockers.  I'm not gay (not that there's anything wrong with that) but still people made fun of me.  Also in one glass this one kid always mocked me my making a funny voice because I had a slight speech impediment.  He did it in front of the whole class and even the teacher laughed.  After awhile I accepted that I was just meant to be made fun of and everyone would do it.  It hurt like hell.  I realize now I have my rights.  But it till hurts.  Anyway I'm just saying you're not alone.
