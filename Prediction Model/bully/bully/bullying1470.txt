Many times my bullies have told me that i deserved this kind of treatment. Even the person i have considered a friend told me that. Later, he has proved to me that he was the same type of bully as my classmates (provoking, teasing, he even slapped me when i refused to give him the reaction of me being offended). What is more interesting, i am imagining that, when i get angry at them, they are telling me that it is my fault, that i have "let myself", which gets me even more angry. Everyone in my head says that. And i feel alone and misunderstood, angry and frustrated when it happens. I would like it to stop.
