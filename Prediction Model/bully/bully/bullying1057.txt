				I was bullied in elementary, middle, and high school. Now I'm trying to finish up my diploma at a new school, and yet again I'm getting bullied. In middle and high school, I didn't even care, but now I do, and it's really pissing me off. There's this one boy, Wess, in two of my classes who tells me to shut up, says I make everyone in the class look stupid, he gives me dirty looks, and calls me a bitch in front of everyone INCLUDING my teachers. They have done nothing, and I'm sick and tired of it. I want to confront him, but I'm not exactly sure what to say. I'm not one to take abuse from others normally, but I feel bad that I make him feel stupid because I'm enthusiastic and I'm smart. I've told my parents but they want to go "Have a talk" with him, and I don't think it will help. So what should I say to this kid to get him off my back?
