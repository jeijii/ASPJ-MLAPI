Peoples opinion on that might differ. The group of people upsetting you could actually be bullying you, but they might not know it hurts you. If you feel it appropriate I would tell them, it helped for me when my friends did it, or you could report it.<br><br>Letting go of the fear might take time, if out are at school, a school councillor could provide free help. But, to lessen the fear you could keep everyone in sight, it helps me.<br><br>Politicians are a bad example as they have often prepared for criticism in advance. But, I usually just walk off and find a place to myself. But, you should tell someone who could help (employer, teacher, etc. It depends on your situation.)<br><br>Laughing it off is not a good idea if it repeats. One insult ok maybe if it is not sever and could be 'banter', but insults that could be taken to heart, or constant insults should be reported.<br><br>Not all people are emotionally strong, and here I honestly have no tips, sorry.
