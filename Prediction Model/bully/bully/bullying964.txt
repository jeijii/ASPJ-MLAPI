				Hi,<br><br>First of all I want to say how sorry I am you are going through this as a nursing student, I am sure you have many wonderful qualities and much to give to the world.<br><br>It really sounds to me that you do not deserve this kind of treatment, but people are cruel, and honestly I have never understood it - but some people feel better about themselves by making other people feel bad about themselves I honestly don't why but it is a fact.<br><br>I think you should concentrate on all your good qualities, you are caring, you are worthwhile and try and cultivate some interests outside of college maybe visiting some old folks in retirement homes.. they love to see young people, and while it might be a bit boring, you will get some wonderful satisfaction of knowing you have brightened someones day when they go for weeks without seeing anybody and older people have some great live experience to share.<br><br>Or join a book club or anything that appeals to you.<br><br>You need to concentrate on nurturing yourself right now and don't give those cruel thoughtless people another thought, they are losers in the long run, because they will never know the beautiful, kind, sensative person you are.<br><br>Take care of yourself and remember you do matter to the Universe.<br><br>Ax
