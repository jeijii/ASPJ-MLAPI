				Another update: Today is the day of the bully's appointment. My daughter has agreed to pick her up &amp; bring her to the appointment site in our town, after which my daughter has to go to her PT job. This woman told my daughter that my husband didn't need to pick her up &amp; return her home, as she says her boss on her second job will pick her up as she has to go immediately to that job. (I'm wondering if she's trying to avoid my husband?) I'm apprehensive, but my daughter tells me not to worry, that she's able to handle this woman&gt; I hope she's right but am worried, as this woman can be so manipulative. If this encounter goes off without a hitch, I will mention to both husband &amp; daughter about cutting all contact. Husband thinks it unnecessary; says "Just tell her no." My daughter knows what she is like but feels sorry for her. I am afraid to feel sorry for her as I'm afraid she will make use of that pity to drag us back into her orbit with pleas for help, constant phone calls, offers of a movie or a trip to eat at the Waffle House (after which she will mention that she sure would appreciate it if you'd agree to help her clean-hint, hint-&amp; maybe you might ought to consider doing another job because it's money, right?) I've decided that if she gets a car &amp; comes here that I'd better not get in the car with her to go ANYWHERE &amp; that I should keep my phone on me at all times so that if something happens I can send my husband a plea for help. Maybe I should not even answer the door if she comes here, but she might stand at the door &amp; yell &amp; scream until somebody answers the door.<br><br>My daughter leaves in a little over an hour. I'm so worried. Part of me wants to let her go; part of me wants to go along to protect her even though I am terrified &amp; I don't even know what I'd be protecting her from. I just want this to be over! I curse the day we met this woman. And I've heard my husband say that before he met her he was praying for somebody to help us clean our house! (Makes me wonder if it was the Lord that sent her....)<br><br>You can see what a state I am in.
