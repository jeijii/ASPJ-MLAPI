				I'm going to warn you that what I am going to say is not what would be considered optimistic and definitely not cheerful.  Reality is not always candy and balloons but keeping a grasp on reality is nonetheless important.<br><br>I totally empathize with you as I have suffered from the same taunts.  It has happened all my life regardless of where I lived, went to school, or worked.  Some environments were better but the attacks on my physical appearance never stopped.  It also never stopped because of how I acted or how I dressed, how I did my hair, or if I tried makeup.  I'm 51 now and all I can say is that it's utterly clear that looks matter to humans.  There have been all kinds of respectable studies and even shows like <span style="font-style: italic">20/20</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">What Would You Do?</span> that absolutely verify this.  People will be nicer or meaner to you just because of how you look and almost no one will own up to it, and I'm talking about all humans.  Please note that I keep mentioning "looks" and not "appearance."   Your physical features (bone structure, skin, nose, etc) are your looks.  We were either born that way or we suffered physical harm that affected our looks.  Your appearance, on the other hand, is how you do your hair, dress yourself, etc.  I point out the difference because it is obviously much easier to change your appearance while changing your looks requires plastic surgery.  I don't deny that we all look better when we dress up than when we dress down.  My point is that, for people who are physically ugly in the wide opinion of the populace, working on the appearance does so little to help that it's useless advice that just victimizes and insults.  As an example, would you tell a black person who is being racially attacked to try dressing better?  Or doubt them altogether by saying, "People aren't mean for no reason, you must have said or done something, try acting nicer"?<br><br>I understand your anger.  I don't know who I feel more anger towards - the people who directly insulted me, the people who witnessed the attacks and either joined in or did nothing, or the people who didn't believe me or told me I need to change how I act, dress, etc , or the people.  Actually, I do know.  I know that it hurts much more and does a lot more damage to my psyche  when I seek out empathy and/or sympathy from likely sources (family, friends, support groups or sites,  trained professionals) and am instead met with disbelief, condemnation for being too sensitive, or direct blame for inviting the attack by not altering my appearance.<br><br>I believe you, I empathize with you,  and I sympathize with you.  You may  pm me if you want to know how I have coped, and continue to cope with this or if you just just want to talk to someone who understands.  I won't put it here because I know much of what I would say to a fellow sufferer would offend most others.  Especially those who think cruelty over looks is as real as a unicorn and if unicorns really exist then it's still your.fault for not wearing a different outfit.
