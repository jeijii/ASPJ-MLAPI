				Welcome to the forum, Ryan.  No need to apologise.  This is a good place for your post and there's nothing incorrect about it whatsoever.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ConcernedChild wrote:</cite>Is this horrific relationship all my doing? Do I deserve the treatment I'm being given? Have I earned all of this? Am I blaming myself because that's what they've taught me to do, or am I truly at fault?</div></blockquote><br>No, this relationship is of your parents' making.  Probably with extensive historic help from your grandparents.  It might be interesting if you haven't already, to observe your parent / grandparent interaction and see if you can pin down where some of this comes from.  For example, your father's over-monitoring could come from having been micromanaged himself as a child.  Or left to run wild and so he's now over-compensating in turn.  And I'm willing to bet that the way your mother talks to you can be heard coming from her parents [since the advice to "focus on behaviour, not child" is relatively recent as far as I know.  And quite hard to implement without thought and practice.]<br><br>Re- do you deserve this?  You don't mention having been a delinquent previously.  If you've not given your parents cause for concern then no, you definitely don't.  If they've caught you smoking, taking drugs, truanting, then I still don't think you deserve the Fort Knox treatment.  But it is perhaps slightly more understandable that your parents would be so focused on trying to control you.<br><br>Another thought, is whether they were gifted children themselves.  If they weren't, then they may simply not know how to deal with you.  Their parenting style might work well for another child with a different temperament.  Ideally they'd've adapted to the child they do have, rather than the one they hoped for.  But that can be difficult.<br><br>Is it possible to negotiate with them over some of their requirements?  The emailing about grades, for instance, isn't teaching you anything about wanting to succeed for yourself.  Or the consequences of failure [outside their reaction to it which won't be relevant once you're an adult.]  Can you discuss having longer on the net at weekends, or banking minutes from one day [if you are out or working offline] to "spend" another time?  <br><br>And, at random, had you considered any martial arts?  They're an excellent way to exercise, to socialise in a formalised manner, to interact with people of all ages, and to give you confidence if the physical abuse ever becomes more than sporadic.  I can see there's a significant danger of your father being over-involved in that too, given his own interests.  If you can avoid that, I think it would have significant benefits longer-term.
