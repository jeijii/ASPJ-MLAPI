				I wasn't always friends with Gina. I had her from grades 7th till 12th.<br><br>Grades 7th-9th: My group of friends and I gave her a hard time (bodysurfing her out of the gym, had others calling her a loser, spreading some rumors, etc.). Sadly I was the female ringleader.<br><br>Grade 10th aka the ''kinda better year for her'': My friends and I were once in a while invite her but none of us would really talked much to her or we would just dare her to do stuff. Sort of like ''Ok, if you do that... then you'll cool and in our group''. If she didn't do it then she wasn't kool for that day so one time I dared her to declare love to some randome guy or usually tell her ''Ok Gina, we'll wait for you at lunch'' but sometimes we didn't. I was still the ringleader too.<br><br>Grade 11-12th ''aka the year it got really bad for me at home and other personal issue (death in the family, etc)'': Ok I was no longer doing those things and basically was trying to make things right. That was really my way of saying sorry without saying it but by showing it. My friends and I invited Gina and some of the other girls more often. Only this time it was for real. Our friendship started developing during that time. <br><br>Present-day: I'm good friends with Gina but not sure if she might still be hurt by what we would do, esp. me the former ringleader? She hasn't mentioned any of it. Well it has passed 8 years since then but should I say something or not? Part of me feels like apologizing but not sure if she would want me to bring back all those bad memories of when we weren't friends? So should I apologize or not mention it? I know I was forgiven but it was still wrong.
