				As someone who has been bullied in the past I have joined this website in hope that I can prevent any other child to ever feel or go through what I went though, I have attempted many suicides during the bullying days and was an obsessive self-harmer, when I look back at my younger self I am shocked at the person I was then, right now I am a strong confident woman and I can easily say I am not afraid of anybody. If any parents are reading this with children who are being bullied my one piece of advice would be to remove your child from this situation ie; move school, move house, move clubs/hobby groups, do not expect your child to listen to a motivational speech from you and be able to confront and conquer the bully/ies , it will not work, and as far as 'youre running away from your fears' goes, forget that, giving them a new opportunity will make them stronger.
