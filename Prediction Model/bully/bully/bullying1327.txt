				IMO I think childhood bullying is worse. As it's been said, that sort of abuse during childhood is eroding to the child's self-concept and identity that they will carry into later life. The nature of bullying during childhood also tends to be more direct - physically this could be in the form of the stereotypical "playground attacks" or psychologically in the form of mockery, vicious name-calling etc.<br><br>I mean no wonder they are so many damn school shootings!<br><br>In adulthood, physical bullying is almost unheard of, and psychological bullying tends to be more covert: Gaslighting, giving all the work to one employee, subtle 'referencing to a certain person' behavior during conferences etc. Although all of this is still damaging and hurtful. With that said though, some form of overt bullying can still befall on adults. <br><br>Along with this adults can take more severe action against their tormentors, just so long as they have witnesses and/or proof. Kids can't really do much about it other than run to the teachers, who as per usual do jack $#%^ about it -- often times during confrontations with the bully, they will even unknowingly elude to the fact that they where informed about it directly from the victim themselves, which just makes the bullying worse.<br><br>The worst is of course when someone is bullied <span style="font-style: italic">both</span> during childhood &amp; adulthood. They'll feel utterly defective about themselves - after all, if they were victimized so much there must be something terribly wrong with them... right?<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Owsi68 wrote:</cite>And if you seek help from mental health specialists then you will be marked for life.

Another very important distinction is that bullying among children is bullying among people who are your peers.  In the adult world the bully could be your authoritative superior or otherwise in a position to absolutely affect your life - your boss, a law official, a doctor, and pretty much anyone in the service sector.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Let it be known that 'joining in behavior' doesn't just occur during adulthood bullying. Have you ever experienced a situation where teachers/lecturers drop their professional persona, in the face of human herd behavior? In other words, they start to secretly join in with the class mobbing? It's real and it's disgusting -- if it means making them feel better about themselves by spinelessly scapegoating a student, they'll do it, at least in my experience. This could be 'aiding' the bullies by using the victim as an example in class, or it could be digging at them slyly, or it could be treating them differently... ad infinitum. And no one is doing anything about it. <br><br>I could go on but I've made my point. I truly hate humans sometimes.
