				Ouch.. i'm really sorry  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral"> <br><br>Not okay for any of you.. including the elderly ladies that are being really difficult for you.<br><br>If they're being disturbed every time anyone goes outside for a smoke at nighttime, can they possibly be moved so they're in a part of the building where they won't be disturbed? <br><br>Staff would obviously have to be careful, since moving someone with dementia to a different location can be difficult for them..  but perhaps that could be a helpful solution if staff plan and do it properly xx
