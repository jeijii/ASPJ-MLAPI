The games they play with you (and you seem to be oblivious to it) are ones that ultimately destroy and ruin you.<br><br>The narcissist is driven by a need to be superior than you and to have you admire him. He has no interest in you, your well being, and the negative impact he has on your life. He wants to devalue you and all his games head there. REALISE THAT and CEASE ALL ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE HIM. You need to find a new job as soon as you can.<br><br>Your level of attractiveness is unlikely to be the only envious quality you have. Are you moral? Intelligent? Confident? Outgoing? Popular? A high performer? Talented in some way? Rich? Famous? An individual? Religious? Have something different about you?<br><br>Those narcissists, sociopaths, and psychopaths assess everyone they come across using the above list. The more boxes you tick the more ideal of a target you are to them. In our culture if you have a positive quality you are told to flaunt it. You need to learn modesty instead to avoid being targetted in the future.<br><br>With your looks that means dressing down at work, not wearing makeup, looking rough, having greasy hair, etc. All the other envious qualities are easy to hide too. Whenever you start a job you are best hiding everything for the first month until you`ve clocked if there are any narcissists, sociopaths, or psychopaths in your department.<br><br>Finally, and this is a hard one for some people to swallow, the targets are quite often those who are naive enough to believe there is good in everyone. You have to realise EVIL PEOPLE EXIST, and in fact they are about 15% of the population. You gullibility over what their human nature is really like keeps leading you back into their snare. Get a new job, cease all contact forever with your narc no matter what.
