				They come to you and call you ugly, you do not go to them and ask to call you ugly, that gives you the power imho. This is my personal perspective.i wouldn't wanna talk to people that does not wanna talk to me. it is their loss not yours. i am truly sorry for what you are going through. stay strong and focus on the road ahead.There is no answer to why they treat you this way . Even if you were to ask them or confront them I AM PRETTY SURE THEY WOULD NOT TELL YOU THE TRUTH. people like that are cowards.
