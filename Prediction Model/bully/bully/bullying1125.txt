				I have a family that was lead by a male narcissist. And now I'm staying with a sibling that has narcissistic traits here and there. They may have learned some of this from their now spouse of like 30 years. I feel like a horse has kicked me in the stomach when they say things to me that make it clear they don't care if I end up completely without housing and die outside.  It's insinuated.  My mom now is like this too., and my friend. Thus I am trying to limit my relationship with my friend after I left another state where I tried to relocate back to until my mom passes in the near future. It was a huge mess, I felt totally manipulated. When I got there I had few choices. I ended up fleeing with a trucker back to my last home state on the west coast. When it comes down to it, I haven't trusted my family since I was like 6 or 7 years old? I'm 45. So all of this is super painful, and didn't get better now that the male narcissist has died.  Thus, I choose my family in support groups, and don't have a solid romance, and when I married, he turned out to be nearly as toxic as the guy who just died(head of my primarily family). I feel pretty alone often. I'm glad this forum is here.
