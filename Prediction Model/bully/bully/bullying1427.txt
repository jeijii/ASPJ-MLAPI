				Ugh, that's a terrible situation <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>You're not unjustified saying this man is a bully.<br>He sounds very abusive and scary, actually.<br><br>Keep sticking to your guns, you're doing the right thing by defending yourself.<br>You don't deserve treatment like that.<br>It just sucks that you're stuck in the middle of things,<br>and it really doesn't help that your family just doesn't get it.<br>You're being a responsible adult by protecting yourself, you're not required to<br>'get along' with everyone in the world.<br>Your family unfortunately don't sound like the most healthy nor supportive people.<br>They're possibly used to the cycle of abuse, you can't expect them to change,<br>all you can do is hope for the best for them... and get help yourself!<br><br>Keep doing the right things for you, and keep posting!<br>If you don't have an out right away (sometimes life interferes like that)<br>you need someplace to vent and to go to.<br>It sounds like when you're able to, moving out on your own would be a good idea.<br>I developed DID when I was younger and I wasn't able to start healing until<br>I got to a safe, supportive place. That involved surrounding myself with supportive people.<br><br>They say "blood is thicker than water" but they're siding with this guy? <br>Sounds kind of messed up to me. How does your sister feel about him treating you this way?<br><br>Lots of hugs to you. You're in a crappy situation but stuff can get better.<br>You're not alone.
