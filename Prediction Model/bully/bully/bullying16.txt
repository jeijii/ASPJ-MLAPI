				I was emotionally abused and neglected as a child, with the resulting low self confidence.  I married an abuser, and it took me a while to "get" that it wasn't my fault.  As I have gained in self-confidence, I see more and more just how much abuse there is in this society.  Very distressing.  <br><br>However, what I am looking at now is the "help" agencies for poor people.   One would think these places, especially those run by churches, would be caring and supportive, but the opposite seems to be true.   Using your checklist for abuse, many of those characteristics would be experienced just in trying to get assistance.    Many of us have seen this, and figured we would be better off to starve rather than to have this inflicted on us.<br><br>I don't think this is something that is very much recognized.   I have only found one article about this, and would like to find more.   Since we poor people tend not to be believed, it is very helpful to have backup resources to refer people to.<br><br>Any suggestions along this line would be helpful.  It is bad enough to be poor.   It is miserable to be poor and harmed everytime one goes for "help".
