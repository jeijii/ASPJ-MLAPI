				hiya..<br><br>that was disgusting for those kids at school to label you as the ugliest girl there.. i'm so so sorry that this ever happened  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I am just sick of people treating me like I am not human and that I have no feelings</div></blockquote><br>^^ you are very welcome and very safe here.. your feelings matter  xx<br><br>I was wondering..  have you got any idea why the people at college don't talk to you..?   I was just trying to work out what could have caused their behaviour.. whether maybe you'd gone to the same school together and they brought this behaviour with them when they transitioned from school to college (they clearly didn't manage to find a decent conscience in the process). <br><br><br>I'm also a bit concerned that you use the terms ''everyone'' and ''all''   - i think that you sound really really isolated and stressed right now and could very much use a helping hand.  I don't like the idea of you feeling so alone and starting to believe that everyone is like those bullies.<br>There are some really truly horrible people in the world but there are also some lovely and decent ones as well..  i'd like to think that you won't let the horrible ones win in pushing you down.  Start climbing up instead and definitely enlist the help of a therapist for a while..  xx
