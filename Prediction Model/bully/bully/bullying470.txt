				I was verbally bullied as a teenager by a man twice my age. A few years later I stumbled into my tormentor and scared them more than they ever scared me by screaming and threatening violence on them. I got a criminal record for it. <br><br>I'm in 2 minds whether it was the right thing to do. I suffered a lot of anxiety and guilt at the time of what the law were going to do with me.<br><br>On the other hand I showed him up and humiliated him in front of his wife and showed him up as the coward he is. He was PETRIFIED and he hid behind his wife. I couldn't believe this "tough guy" was such a pussy when it came to the crunch. It was funny how pathetic he looked.<br><br>Don't bother trying to make a bully feel bad morally. They have no conscience. The only form of proactive revenge that works is intimidation or degradation based on what they lack superficially.<br><br>Also, be AFRAID of the police before making your attack. They don't give a ###$ about who's the real victim. They lack a conscience as much as the bully does. All they give a ###$ about is numbers and how many people they can incriminate.<br><br>As stated previously however, the BEST form of revenge is success.<br><br>Try to achieve your dreams and a strong life and you will probably be living a happier life than your bully and when you see them, stare at them as smug as you can. That will probably hurt them more than beating them up.
