				I am not a dr so I dont have all the answers but I do know that it boils down to social skills and if it bothers you then read up on it. I have always been someone who observes people..I love to people watch and I have taken numerous psychology and socialogy classes. Maybe you get too comfortable with friends too soon and you dont think before you speak....maybe the chick was PMSing and lashed out the other night. Have you talked to her since?
<br>
<br>My advice based on what I know of you is to test the waters and know your boundaries when it comes to appropriate behavior. You have learned this in the past so try to avoid it, if you come across the same sitation again. There is no need to avoid people or remain silent. hey another thing..... body language is a huge factor it is I believe 80-90% of how we communicate. Read a book on it and it may help. 
<br>
<br>I hope I have given advice in a good way!!! Take care
