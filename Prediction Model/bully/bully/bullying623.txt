				Two years ago I posted about my sisters boyfriend beginning to bully me and how distraught I was about being in the situation. I was scared of him at first so I just automatically accepted it and didn't fight him. Over time, I began to get my courage up and began to resist and fight him, he didn't like that it was a challenge to bully me anymore so he stopped doing it. Unfortunately what he had planned for me was even worse. He is an assistant coach for the wrestling team at my school, so when he got mad that I was resisting and fighting him, he had some of his students began to bully me. I thought with my newly found courage it would be no problem to fight them off, but boy was I wrong. <br>Because I fought them, they made me go through two weeks of hell everyday after school to "crack me" and after those two weeks I did crack and finally accepted that I couldn't fight them. I accepted my place as a nerd and simply did what they told me. I am still bullied by the wrestlers, but it is a lot easier dealing with it now that I have accepted it rather than fight it still.<br>So, if you're bullied and you think you want to fight your bullies, don't. You will only make it worse for yourself. It gets so much easier if you just accept it and do what they say. Remember it is only a temporary situation.
