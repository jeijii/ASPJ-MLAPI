				I was bullied in Jr High and a few years later I ran into my bullies, they acted like nothing had happened. It was like running into anyone else. I thought to myself "Why should it bother me? Why should I get any kind of reaction to them, when they seem unaffected" I chose then on the spot that it didn't matter anymore and it was something that was in the past. They were friendly and I was friendly back. <br><br>Could you tell yourself something along those lines? Some kind of self talk. Other than that, what about asking him out for a drink? That would likely do the trick unless he's still a totally mean person.
