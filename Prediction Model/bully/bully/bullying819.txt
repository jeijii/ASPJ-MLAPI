I would be surpirised and... a different feel would com over me... how would I discribe it.<br><br>You found something new!  Now that you are doing it, why.  How do you feel about it?  Why do you feel about it?  So many mysteries... not enough answers...<br><br>You are puzzle.<br><br>But, your not just any puzzle, I would have this fatherly touch... a touch I found when my daughter was born.  So I would see things as I saw my own daughter...an adventure...<br><br>So you are an adventure.  Adventure?<br><br>The only thing I know about make-up is it was created for many reasons.. to cover your face  as if your face was no longer their... or, like more of an accent to what you have already.  To make eyes look bigger and more defined, to make sure that alll who gaze upone that face sees your eyes... since that is the most captivating.  Hair style... just the front around your face.  You could have hair down past your waste, but does the hair around your face create that soft oval you would like?<br><br>All coming from a guy?<br><br>Never ever go by na bully and what they tell you you should do.  Never take friends at face value.... they might be jealous of you... Never take enemies for anything... they mean nothing and know nothing...<br><br>I know.  How can I guy make this stuff up?  Because he never did... He paid attention... :D
