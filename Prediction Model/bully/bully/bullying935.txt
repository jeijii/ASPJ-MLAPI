				There are a lot of anti-bullying organisations in existence already, but from what I have found. there isn't much of a focus on making a change: it seems to be mainly just philosophy and reassuring the victim it is not their fault. This has a place, but it seems to me to be ineffective when dealing with bullying as a bully is unlikely to change his or her thinking soon, or to be concerned about the impact on others. Also, if it is tolerated it will continue. There is a system of laws, but unless the bullying is physical, it is difficult to involve the police in the matter, and it is something which is probably more appropriate to be dealt with by the ordinary citizen. But it does need to be dealt with, and the ordinary citizen needs the power to do so. Authority figures can help, but they have to be trustworthy, and this is not always the case - some are bullies themselves. Therefore, what I propose is to form something which involves incidents of bullying being reported and they are investigated accordingly (in an appropriate and civilised manner of course!) Working together will make this possible.<br>What I am stuck on is what procedures to employ if a bully is found out. This is only a possibility, and I am not formally planning to put it into existence as yet, but  <br>I would also appreciate your feedback on the idea generally.
