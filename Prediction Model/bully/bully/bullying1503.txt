				I rather like Empty Guy's method.  There may be consequences, but it'll work.<br><br>But lets be practical here.  Here's another method, I tried it and it worked quite well . . . at the very least it can curb his behavior;  you mentioned that he's lacking in skills and education right?  Well do this, when the time is ripe, and preferably in front of the other co workers - point out that the reason that he is a poop head is obviously because he's trying to compensate for his lack of skill and expertise.  Remind him that he's going nowhere in the company, is stuck there, and YOU have options.<br><br>I did such to this 40 yo girl at work.  Our positions require 4 year degrees, but she has no education and managed to sneak in because the boss who hired her (he's now gone btw) thought her a princess.  It really threw her off balance when I pointed this out to her.  They may not respond at first. or may seem violent for a brief moment, but then they'll go off in a corner like a whipped puppy with his tail between it's legs.<br><br>Best of all, it's totally non-violent, the truth, and cannot be held against you in anyway by HR or what not!!
