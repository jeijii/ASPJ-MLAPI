				Sorry about what happen.  I can relate..  <br><br>I was bullied,  harassed!   <br><br>When I was protected by my father,  that was not a problem,  then the family split apart and I was on my own!  I was not prepared for it and went into shock!  and stayed in shock. I was ran over by the heard,  I never had a chance.  I never came back to normal.   I had no one anymore and did not care about anything anymore!   The bullies sense blood!  they know when your weak,  they are predators..    Ultimately,  it is the system that allows bullies to flourish and drive kids to kill themselves, ultimately we drive the system,  so we the people are the sociopaths creating this situation that is blamed on everyone else.  Western societies breed sociopathic family to flourish in the market place and make money!  Who ever gets to the top wins.  If your sister or brother or the neighbors kids across the street get destroyed in high school,  that is OK for the greater family system to survive;  sacrifices must be made for the greater of the whole.  ITs better that a few children die, then for the rest of us to gain less competitive pay checks.  ITs all about money!  and the worship of selv's as Gods.  Godless people mindlessly running around the watering whole trampling everything that is not strong enough for the full gallop! <br><br>Children are technically not bullied they are murdered or mind-murdered-crippled.  Technically they are being terrorized on there own home land..  It is an act of treason for one citizen to create a situation of terror and violence against another!  That should be enough for one to start civil war against society!  When a child realizes this, they realize they are powerless,  and their lives are real-estate bought and sold by the state, they have no rights over  there own bodies.    Out of dignity and sadness they would rather kill themselves then be humiliated in an in-human undignified way!  <br><br>Bulling is a sick manifestation of the competitive sociopathic consumer state!  Lets breed competition and prepare the young lads for business!   Not much human compassion.   It seems that its Ok for a child to die for the state to live as they wish! and we are the state!
