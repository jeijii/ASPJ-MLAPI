				Sad to say, but yes... he is bullying you. But in his mindset he doesn't think nor believe he is in the wrong.  Look up anything you can on Narcissism.  Classic tendencies are what you described.  Your choice over all as to how you handle him.  You leave, he will either make you life even more miserable and stay just outside the law or you'll never hear from him again.  If you leave be prepared for either scenario.  If you stay...he could get worse or you could stand up to him.  Doing either could bring positive or negative reactions.  Hard to say.  I've dealt with a major Narcissist and alcoholic for  years now.  I left.  Loved him but could not live with him.  His world fell apart and then he realized the only thing that kept it all together before was my presence.  I ignored him at first.  Then I laid the rules on my terms.  So far other than he hasn't stopped drinking it's been the best 6 months with very little issues and when they start to rear their ugly heads I call him on them real quick.  I was even told no one ever stood up to him and he had no idea how bad he was.  This is strictly from my own experience with a very smart, very high functioning narcissistic alcoholic.  Great when he's good, but when he's bad...well, he has a lot of  people watching him and he doesn't like it, so he knows he has to be good.  Good luck
