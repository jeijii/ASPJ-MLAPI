				I'm sorry for your office condition. I agree that you should not give any private information. <br><br>For the personal question, give the most general answer to them. General Answer is boring. Be one-liner, if possible just give one word for the answer. Don't tell the details.<br><br>You can politely say to them that you need to work and too distracted by the chat. This tactic always works for me.<br><br>Pretend to listen to their brags. Focus yourself on work or something else. Give them one-liner response if needed.
