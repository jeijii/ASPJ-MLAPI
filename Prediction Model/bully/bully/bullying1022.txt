				Do you have any person/authority you could talk to about it? Maybe a couple of teachers? They could at least hang out with you when you are likely to be attacked. That might make the bullies a bit less likely to attack. You just need to make the right connections.<br><br>If I were in the same school with a person I was physically abusive towards, and the person ended up beating me up, I'd probably be besides myself with rage and I'd spare no effort to make the person suffer. There's a chance that some of the people who are bullying you have a similar way of being, so you should be careful not to escalate the issue into something more serious.
