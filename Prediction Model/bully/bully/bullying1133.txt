They come up to me with mock eagerness (eyes wide, voices high pitched, acting so eager and purposefully dumb) saying "Can I touch your hair?" or "Can I smellyour hair?"<br><br>Anything I do is apparently funny. If I say no, the laugh (and they do it anyways, no matter what my answer is.) they try to grab my (extremely long) hair, I smack their hand, they laugh. I back up -they follow me- and laugh. I do anything, and everything is funny to them, apparently. Theres just no talking reason to them, and it's frustrating.<br><br>I had been fed up, I am not a patient peerson, and I'm the only one standing up for myself. Part of the reason I left my two previous friends was because they wouldn't help me stand up against the bullies. They would u\just watch. Another reason is because they invited a girl to sit at our table (the one who later threw skittles at me) so I left to sit alone. Then a group invited me over, and they are my new friends.<br><br>There has been a band of pressure and pain stretching from my temple across my forehead to my other temple. It's been hurting for weeks and isn't letting up. It's hurting even as I type this. The school nurse said it might be stress, but I think it's frustration...</span></span>
