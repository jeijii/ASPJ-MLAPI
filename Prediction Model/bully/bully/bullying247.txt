				I'm an authority figure, but kind of a depressed one right now.  I tend to let people walk all over me, then when I stand up for myself or call them on their crap, I get the crap kicked out of me, in a sense.<br><br>It's getting to a point where I'm ready to collapse in exhaustion. And I wonder if I'm being too hard on those I am confronting.  They seem to feel hurt but then they hurt me more.  I don't know if I'm right/wrong, etc.<br><br>I'm too tired and traumatized to get into any detail.  Two clients were very harsh for me for like the fifth time.  I called them each on it and they got vicious or cried.  I threw my "the customer is always right" thing b/c I knew if I let them treat me that way it wasn't good for them.  And I tried to balance nice-standing up for myself.  It didn't matter.  They couldn't handle me calling them out on their disrespect, no matter how sweetly I did it.<br><br>I feel very, very beat up.  I'll just say one of my jobs is as an adult educator.  These adults act like children, some of them....Generation "Me."<br><br>I have a terrible history of getting bullied when I'm depressed.  In the winter esp Dec-Jan I tend to get bullied. Feb too.  I try to lift myself out but it doesn't seem to work.  My pdoc doesn't want to do anything with my meds.<br><br>I just have to wait this mood out.  And that's fine.  It's not that bad.  But people are more likely to mess with me when I'm tired/off guard.  I try all these skills that I use in therapy.  The type of jobs I have involve having to deal with difficult, disturbed people.  I try to tell myself it's not me but I'm scared....scared of losing jobs if I don't do whatever they want.<br><br>Anyway, can' t provide more details.  Just needed to reach out.
