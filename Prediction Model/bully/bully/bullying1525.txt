The first time encounter with someone who is utterly self-involved, abusive, who is entitlement minded to be abusive, well, it leaves your head reeling with questions, why!  If so I do understand why you want to know what happened, but as others have written too, the thing is you probably aren't going to be able to understand him or his reasons beyond a certain point.  What you do know with absolutely certainty is how badly he has treated you.  <br><br>I do hope you can reach a point where the want to have those questions answered dies down, and you choose to want to feel good about yourself again. Abusive people tear others down, and unfortunately it works sometimes to keep them coming back for more.  How much is too much varies from person to person, but at some point the why's don't matter anymore.  It's enough to know that this person makes you feel terrible, and what kind of relationship is that?
