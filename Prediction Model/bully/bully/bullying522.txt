				Hello Catherine
<br>
<br>Well, I'll wager that you're a very nice and unappreciated person.  No one deserves bullying, especially you.  I think the best ammunition against a bully is to make them realize that you don't appreciate what they are doing.  I've found that when attacked I will approach the person one-on-one and sincerely tell them how they have hurt me, how they have made me feel, and that I don't deserve it.  Often unmasking the beast is the best way of defeating it.  Sometimes you may be met with sarcasm, but it feels good and affirming to at least confront your attacker and know that you are a good person who doesn't deserve to be abused.
