The bully gets confused of mad and tries harder. So what? The bully will eventually realize he/she can't win, and if not, the bully loses all supporters and thus all momentum. It's not like poking a wild animal with a stick, it's like walking out of their territory and preventing your own demise. Attacking a wild animal violently, however, is a great way to get killed. Violence leads to more violence.  And I'm sure authorities wouldn't want you attacking an animal either. Physical confrontation has way too many detriments to be even close to beneficial. The way I've listed only has benefits in the long term. And since you included Jesus as your conclusion, I'll add that Jesus said to turn to the other cheeck.</div></blockquote><br><br>You're not getting it; if a bully isn't afraid of confrontation then the chances are he won't need backup at all. <br>You honestly think that he'll just keep insulting you without escalating the situation?<br><br>Play that game if you like, but if it were me then making me mad would lead to more extreme violence and a vendetta. I don't think this is the kind of advice that people should adopt in dealing with this type of aggressor. <br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I'll add that Jesus said to turn to the other cheek</div></blockquote><br><br>Jesus was bullied to death before his 34th birthday and what you're proposing isn't "turning the other cheek", you're proposing "making the bully confused, mad and try harder."<br><br>I'll leave my commenting on your "advice" alone from now on.

They made a huge difference by turning the other cheek. The intent is to create peace, which in those three situations, it worked. And even the Romans, who bullied Jesus to death, converted to Christianity. It's not that you're trying to make the bully confused or angry, but it will eventually make a difference, as history has proven through the Civil Rights Movement, the cause against Apartheid, and even the genocide of the Karen people in Burma. You can't argue with the results. It's not that what I'm saying doesn't make sense, it's that you're ignoring crucial evidence in your stubbornness.
