				I was bullied for about 5 years (ish) at school-mostly it was taunts, and the times it did get a little violent wern't really that bad. Despite this I just don't seem to be able to move on-and although I thought I'd managed to put a lid on it more and more things are returning back to me with led to a nasty bout of self harm which has recently started again. I just can't seem to get away from the little freak that screws up all the time, and it's affecting all my relationships. I don't underdtand what's wrong with me, I'm teased a little at my new school as well, but its nothing that big, so why can't I just move on?! how do you move on and stop letting things get on top of you?
