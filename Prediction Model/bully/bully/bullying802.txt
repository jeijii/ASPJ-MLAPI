				The death of my father was a shock and traumatized me. It changed my life and I am still in shock. It also made me very sensitive and vulnerable for teasing and bullying. I feel easily offended and defenseless.<br><br>I have intrusive thoughts like flashbacks about every negative situation I lived or could live and it feels so real. ItÂ´s like being bullied all the time.<br><br>This is why I am not leaving my home so often.<br><br>I hope someone can please help me.
