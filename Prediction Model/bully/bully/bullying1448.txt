				Before I begin, I just want to state that I’m going through what I think is hocd (not what I’m going to write about) and my great grandma just passed away two days ago so I’m not exactly in the best state. So Where do I even start? Last year my friend group was leaving me out of events and I didn’t take it well because I complained about it and needed up losing my best friend and my entire group, so for most of this year I have had hardly any friends that I could turn two. I felt like it was time to stop being upset about things like this and just believe that everything happens for a reason, as my mum always says and I appreciate her saying because it really changed my out look on life. I asked my old friend group if I could join their group again, they said yes, and frankly I’m doing everything I can to prevent drama. But recently they have been going to a lot of things without me again? I used to be really loud and annoying but I have mostly changed that and am now shy. You may be thinking that I’m just thinking to early and thy are just getting used to me again, but another new girl that they don’t like was invited too? One friend is also blocking me out of everything and never lets me speak. Look I’m not even sure that they are going anywhere and I might be jumping to conclusions wag too fast, but i don’t know what to do ?
