				Someone at work is badmouthing me big time like never before. I know who and I am assuming what they are saying, considering the reaction from my co-workers. Some of them stopped talking to me, some look at me with disgust, while the person who is doing it became kinda popular and everybody is very friendly with her.<br><br>No one came and told me anything to my face. But I know. <br><br>It came so hard on me, that I took a whole week off, I just couldn't be around those people anymore.<br><br>I was thinking to address this situation by making a statement in group chat. I don't want to be a silent victim. But it's hard for me to clearly think at this moment with all the emotions. Will it make it better or worse if I say something? I was never friends with any of them in the first place, and they talked here and there, but nothing that bad and there was always some work respect.
