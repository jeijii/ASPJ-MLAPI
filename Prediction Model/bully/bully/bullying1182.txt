				You have difficult questions on your mind.  But this explains everything to me:<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>porcelainne wrote:<br>Then, M started texting my boyfriend things like "I would have invited you out but I figured you'd bring the roadblock in your life along, too."</div></blockquote><br><br>This tells me and other things you describe in your post that you are not a complete part of their clique or group of friends.  You can be with them yet you can also get treated shabbily.  If it was me I'd think clearly about how to handle this.  I'd recommend talking to your dear friend whom you trust and make a good decision.  I think it is bullying in a light form.  Because it isn't like they are  cyberbullying you or physically bullying you.  It's messing with your mind.  And I wouldn't let any friend(s) of mine do that to me.  You are in a position where you are unable to even confront them because they make it seem like it was nothing.  Your boyfriend is either blind to not see this or he can't make the choice to leave this group of friends.  Things like this happen even in marriages, where the husband chooses the buddies over the wife and it hurts the wife's feelings a lot.  But she stays with him, usually.  Depending how bad it gets.  Myself, I wouldn't stay with a guy who treated me like that.  I know you love your boyfriend and I'm not saying to leave him but you need to express how you really feel.  Watch and see how things progress, try your best to stand up for yourself when this type of thing happens again, confront those people and eventually they will show their true colors or they will show who they  really are and what their intentions truly are.  Then you can make a decision and feel strong about it.  Your boyfriend also needs to see how things really are and also maybe need to make a decision.  <br><br>My marriage was like that in a way.  It took 7 years of off and on treatment behind my back and some decisions my husband made such as telling me that his family came before me, his wife.  Well, finally one day I said I want a divorce.  He said no please.  I practically  said ###$ off, I'm going to get a divorce.  I was sick of it.   Well I got sick and had to wait on getting a divorce and then he changed for the better and I am still married.  But he knows that if he doesn't treat me right, I'm outta here.  That's just the tough me talking.  And I am tough just like you are too.
