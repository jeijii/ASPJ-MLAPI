				Anna,<br><br>I am very puzzled by this but the fact that it's a Caribbean/West African thing seems to be the most likely reason for the specific type of bullying that is going on.  I mean, there'd be no other reason as to why they have all independently done the same thing, right?  Regarding the bullying itself, do you interact with your colleagues in a positive way at all?; or are do you feel isolated from them?  If you are isolated and they have never gotten a chance to see you as a real person with thoughts and feelings, then they will continue bullying without guilt.  That's the 'pack' mentality.  If you try to let them know more about you, then they will see you more as a person, and not an object that they can do whatever they please to.<br><br>In addition to this, I want to say that your post brought up some memories from school when I also felt as if I was bullied.  I also had the cough thing done to me, but mostly it was just guys a few years ahead of me smiling and joking at me.  The thing is, if I was stronger-minded back then, it wouldn't have bothered me.<br><br>Kevin
