				Hello people that take their time to help others.<br><br>First of I am not english so excuse my grammar, but I didnt find a forum in my language.<br><br>So first of I will introduce myself and I will make this as short as possible.<br><br>Until the age of 17 everything seemed fine in my life, I mean I got beaten up in elementary school for beeing skinny, but I had good friends and fought back so I didnt care much.<br>Highschool was even better with very good friends that I know until today.<br>I joined the millitary(had too) for a year and I was the skinny guy again and everybody hated me, this time I didnt fight back and ignored it.<br>After that I joined the police(dont ask me why) and again everybody hated me for beeing(now) shy and skinny. I quit.<br>After that I had mental problems(not sure exacty when they started) of beeing overly depressed and also a social anxiety.<br>even shyer now I learned graphic design and again got excluded/avoided but finished it.<br>after that I redid my a level, isolated again, beeing the outsider guy. finished it<br>Finaly after that I consulted a therapist(who only seemed to listen all the time) and took the drugs they gave me.<br>The social anxiety that got quite bad until that moment was somewhat goeing away again, I was no longer getting so nervous around others.( a little bit still, but way better)<br>Then I had some jobs some went fine(with coworkers) and sometimes I got fired for beeing to shy.<br><br>[<span style="text-decoration: underline">b]Thats where we are at now.[/b]</span><br><br>right now I am doing graphic arts at a college(1month in) and my problems have changed a bit, no more verbal or physical abuse but now I am getting completely excluded by my costudents.<br>we are a small group at college and the guys do facebook groups, go out together, go eat together, etc etc often to form a community to later work together in teams at the college.<br><br>everybody gets asked to join, everybody is in those groups, everbody has exchanged numbers, etc.<br>Ãªverybody except me, they completely ignore me, they dont greet back, when I try to talk to them they ignore me and when there is a meeting everybody gets asked except me.<br><br>Its really embarrasing and somewhat hurts. And I question myself a lot(what did I do wrong, etc)<br>and its a problem because we are supposed to do our work together later on.<br>my motivation to continue the college has really suffered and I want to quit again.<br><br><br>thats my story, thx for reading, I would ask a friend or my parents, but I dont want to seem weak infront of friends, and my parents would just call me a victim anyway<br><br>thats why I ask you
