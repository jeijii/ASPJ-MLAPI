				Something I have been thinking about lately. As a child, back in Russia, I often went to this summer camp, on a lake, near the city of Zvenigorod, a nice place, honestly. But, there was a way there, a tradition, I guess: night-time pranks. One example was "pasting", where you get splattered all over your face and head with toothpaste, while you are asleep. Then, there were instances where people's shoes were glued to the floor, also at night, so they could not tear them off in the morning. It can be dismissed as simply "boys being boys" (the pranks were usually in the boys' wing and between boys, girls were... too smart or too mature or too sophisticated for that foolishness, I suppose lol), and that is how our adult Supervisors tended to look at it, just shrugged it off. But the thing is, I now realize, is that some of the boys were pranked more often and more viciously than the others. The <span style="font-style: italic">salagi</span>, "fresh bloods", those who were new, the first-timers, they had it the worst (I had to go through that myself). The pranksters would figure out their worst fears, and use those against them in the prank. One kid I remember, Pavel, he had claustrophobia (fear of tight, closed spaces) and nyctophobia (fear of darkness). So, one night, they locked him in the bathroom, and shut off all the lights. He spent several hours in there and almost had a nervous breakdown. After someone found him and let him out, he just shook and was unable to speak for awhile. It happened to me too. During my first summer there, I foolishly let it slip that I have a small fear of snakes. And, of course, I found a bunch of grass snakes from the nearby forest in my bed that night...  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"> After my third summer there, I was no longer pranked in that manner. I became accepted as an old-timer  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink">  But, there were some really mean pranks against some of the boys, especially the ones with some disadvantage, or defect, like this one kid who stuttered, he was picked on and pranked all the time, as i recall; and even one girl, an unpopular, overweight one... the girls did not usually do that stuff, as I said, but when they did, they could be much, much meaner and more wicked than us boys  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked">  <br><br>There were the "stink grenades" too: chopped-up bits of firecrackers mixed with... I am sorry... human feces, inside a balloon or a small bag, with a short fuse. Usually thrown into the showers when they are full, or into a room full of sleeping people (at night, or around 12:00 AM, the Afternoon Nap). But that was usually a general attack, most often between feuding rooms or units (groups of the children in the camp, by age). But, there was plenty of individual nasty pranks too, as I said. <br><br>My question is, do you think that was bullying, or just, "boys being boys"?
