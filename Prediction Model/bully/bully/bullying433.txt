				I'm not hard on myself, don't worry. I know that it is not my fault. But whoever is at fault doesn't really matter for me and my life.
<br>
<br>What matters is that my rational mind tells me that I am missing out on something. I'm still a virgin and that with 22 and I have zero friends. Humans are social creatures, we are simply made that way. I mean I often tell myself I don't need anyone and they don't need me but that doesn't make any logical sense if you think about it longer. 
<br>
<br>Whenever I tried to make friends I could joke around and so on, no problem. Some really like me. But when it comes to anything more intimate I feel like there is some sort of wall standing between me and anyone else. And sometimes I loose every interest.
<br>
<br>But there's no actual reason why I still feel like that. People around me are all geeks like me and nice and openminded people. 
<br>
<br>People sometimes make comments that imply that they feel uncomfortable around me. Like once someone said that I seem permanently angry which I agree with. I am very often angry and actually savour that feeling. Another said that people give me automatically respect because I have such an intense stare.
<br>
<br>And my brain just doesn't want to shut up that something is wrong/off with me and that I would be happier with a bunch of friends.
<br>
<br>I don't really know what to do. Don't have the money to pay sessions at the psychologist.
