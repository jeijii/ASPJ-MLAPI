				whose child is it..?<br><br>If the child was mine then i'd deal with him/her very differently than i'd deal with someone elses.. <br><br><br>If the child was mine then i'd explain why that language is inappropriate and then give them a time-out..  <br>if they carried on doing it then the punishments would get harsher..  confiscations of items such as games console, grounded and not allowed to go to the park.. not allowed to go to a friends for dinner etc.. <br><br>My daughter has a no swearing and no slang usage around me rule..<br><br>I did ban her completely from swearing and using slang but she got bullied at school for not talking the same way as the other kids.. therefore the rule was changed to reflect this. <br><br>If the child wasn't mine then hmnn.. there's little that i can do other than to feel sorry for the child and wish them the best..  <br>I hear children swearing all the time and it sounds so wrong coming from these cute little people who haven't even managed to quit dribbling when they speak yet.
