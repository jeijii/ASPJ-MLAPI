				I know, I know. You are right, and I do apologize for what I wrote.
<br>You must understand how bad my life has been completely destroyed by this and other things, as well, that have happened to me in my past. I let my anger slip at the moment of my post, and now regret my wording. 
<br>
<br> What I mean to say really is that "something" serious should be done. Something that can teach the kids how wrong it is to bully, and how horrible the consequences can be on their victims. And something that will really teach a lesson and have a lasting impression. Though at their age (the bully) cannot truly understand the ramifications of his actions. So i'm lost as to a suitable punishment and therefore I reacted harshly and wrongly. 
<br>
<br> Although I do not retract my statement of "terrorist" as this is what they are doing. (realize I speak literally, as well) They <span style="font-weight: bold">are</span> terrorizing people for their own fun or benefit of some sort. Or just acting out for some reason.
<br>
<br> And I am aslo fully aware of the problems that bullies are most likely harboring themselves. They could be beaten by a parent or many other possible scenarios. And they do need some professional help, and support as well as the victims.
<br>
<br>                                                                  My apologies again.
