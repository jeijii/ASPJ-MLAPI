				Yes, it is VERY difficult for me to speak up for myself. This has created a bit of a problem because my husband doesn't hesitate to argue with her. He has told her how irritated I am, so she accuses him of putting words in my mouth. And several times when I did timidly speak up she would accuse my husband of turning me against her. So I feel that I really must speak up &amp; not depend on my husband to speak for me because she won't believe it unless she hears it from me. (Maybe not even then.) She called yesterday before I got back from the cleaning job &amp; wanted someone here to go get her &amp; take her to an appointment. She lives something like 20 miles from here. No idea where the appointment. My husband told her he couldn't help her because he had to go to work later &amp; that I wasn't home yet. He also told her that I was very irritated with her. &amp; that's when she said, "Oh, you're putting words in her mouth!" She then texted my 19-yr-old daughter &amp; tried to get her to pick her up. My daughter was unable to do so because she also has a PT job &amp; would be working. I could have gone, but I didn't because I just couldn't bear facing her, but now I feel guilty. She has no car right now but is looking for one. (She had one but must have lost it in NJ; my husband thinks she probably fell behind on her car payments &amp; it was repossessed,) I have been praying &amp; asking the Lord to show me the right thing to do. I've begged Him to get this woman out of our lives. I thought she was gone but now she is back to torment us. I suppose she does need help. but why does it have to be us? (Most of the members of her own family don't speak to her, so I guess she can't ask them for help.) My life may be worth something, but I'm willing to die if that's how I can escape her,
