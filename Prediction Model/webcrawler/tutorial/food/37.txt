    Recently, somebody forwarded me an article from USA Today titled  , which featured the many benefits of following a .        The article commented on the fact that if we look at the natural world, we would never find any other living creatures that are overweight (unless it‚Äôs our overfed pets). It‚Äôs almost hard for our minds to conjure up the image of an overweight plant or an overweight lady bug.This may be due to the fact that all other living creatures consume a steady diet of raw foods while humans are eating more cooked, processed foods and artificial toxin-containing foods.Thanks to irresponsible commercial farming techniques that depend on chemical fertilizers, pesticides,  and hormones to grow crops on already overworked land, a large percentage of today‚Äôs food supply has become saturated with toxins and has very little nutritional value.In todays world even the majority of raw foods may contain harmful toxins. If we can‚Äôt count on raw fruits and vegetables to be pure sources of nutrition, how are we supposed to obtain the energy necessary for life?The answer lies in choosing . Even better, you should grow your own food organically in a , provided you don‚Äôt live near sources of pollution such as refineries, heavy industry, or freeways.
	‚Äú‚ÄòOrganic‚Äô is a labeling term that denotes products produced under the authority of the Organic Foods Production Act. The principal guidelines for organic production are to use materials and practices that enhance the ecological balance of natural systems and that integrate the parts of the farming system into an ecological whole. Organic agriculture practices cannot ensure that products are completely free of residues; however, methods are used to minimize pollution from air, soil and water.‚Äù 
It‚Äôs becoming increasingly common to see organic fruits and vegetables at many grocery stores. Most likely, you can find a local farmer‚Äôs market in or near your city, especially near rural areas. A farmer‚Äôs market is the best place to buy your food because it is grown in your local environment and picked ripe, plus it supports your local, small-production farmers.        It is a way of eating that involves a huge dietary increase in the number of unprocessed and uncooked fruits and vegetables, as well as seeds, nuts, grains (mostly sprouted) and beans. A food is considered raw if it is uncooked or ‚Äúprepared‚Äù below 116¬∞F, as above this temperature range, food begins to lose its essential nutrients and enzymes, or its ‚Äúvital life force.‚ÄùThe more we can eat foods that maintain that aliveness, the more ‚Äúlife force‚Äù we ourselves will be able to embody. Remember Life=Life and Death=Death. More than half a century ago in his book Prescription for Energy, Charles de Coti-Marsh explained, ‚ÄúBy eating live foods you create a live body. Live foods contain essential nutrients the body needs to create and maintain energy. Dead foods speed age, decrease ability, and decrease energy ‚Ä¶ they are useless when dead‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe best way to approach raw foods is to gradually incorporate more and more raw fruits and vegetables into your diet. A good start is to try to eat 75% raw and 25% lightly cooked (especially in regard to whole grains).  Although I personally do not condone eating meat, I have added the safest meats to eat (upon request from consumers) in this general raw food diet plan so some people can make a gradual transition to a 100% raw diet. When we cook foods, we inevitably destroy some of the enzymes, vitamins and minerals necessary for good health. If we eat too much overly-cooked, microwaved and processes foods, it can clog our colon, which may lead to a whole host of problems, including, cancer, heart-disease, diabetes and many other degenerative diseases.Cooking may actually upset the natural structure of food, robbing it of its essential nutritional value. Ed Douglas, the director of the , believes that the human body was never meant to eat cooked food. Stephen Arlin, co-author of the book Nature‚Äôs First Law: The Raw Food Diet, even goes so far as to state that, ‚ÄúCooked food is poison.‚ÄùIf you slowly begin to eat in this fashion, you will be amazed at your increased energy levels, youthful appearance and decreased visits to the doctors office. Increasing raw food intake has also been linked to a decreased need for sleep, with many reporting that they have more energy when they wake up in the morning, and that they find it easier to get out of bed!Other benefits of following a raw food diet include improved skin appearance, excess weight loss, improved digestion, the reduction of many diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, as well as many other health debilitating ailments. Raw foods typically do not have as many trans and saturated fats, as compared to most cooked foods, especially fast food, junk food and any other processed foods.Raw foods are also extremely high in nutrients such as potassium, magnesium, fiber and plant phytochemical. A report from the Journal of Nutrition stated that increased use of raw foods in our diet lowers both cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the body , some of the main indicators for heart disease, obesity & high blood pressure.Furthermore, a raw food diet usually involves less packaging and less use of energy sources for cooking, thus making them the near perfect solution for eco-friendly eating. Raw foods also do not usually come in cans or plastics, thus reducing our intake of the harmful chemicals that can be emitted through canned and packaged containers. Don Weaver, the author of ‚ÄúThe Survival of Civilization,‚Äù states that an increased raw food diet is the ‚Äúmost healthful diet for humans and the Earth as a whole.‚ÄùIf you are beginning to eat more raw fruits and vegetables, make sure to buy only organic or locally grown, as many of the toxins present in non-organic foods, such as , will not be eliminated with raw eating. Also, avoid eating raw meat, as it can be a host to a wide range of bacteria and .There is so much information regarding raw foods and personally I believe the best raw food diet is the fruitarian diet. However, everyone is different and you should always do thorough research before radically changing your diet.

PLEASE BE SERIOUS. THANK YOUvery helpful for me to fight against weight gain. nice idea, thanks!I love an apple early in the mornings. Sweet and juicy!I couldnt agree more. organic is the way to go!  I take a slightly different slant as i concentrate on making healthy eating fun for kids and fun for adults who are trying to slim down.The truth of the matter is that children are mini adults therefore they too have motivating factors to inspire them to eat healthy foods. Us adults are in some way more stubborn than children, ironically however these five factors are true of all of us.1) Tasty choices. Many kids love plums, pears, watermelon, peaches, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, cherries, blueberries, strawberries, and pineapples and it‚Äôs far too often kids‚Äô fruit alternatives are restricted to only apples and bananas, and maybe oranges and grapes too. Try corn bran, Spoon-Sized Shredded Wheat, or oatmeal with fresh berries.
2) The limitation factor. If there are healthy foods readily available, children will pick their favorites from amongst those healthy choices.
3) Presentation needs to be FUN. Multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns compete against us all the time when we are deciding what to feed our children. TV doesn‚Äôt always help either because there are many commercials that promote sweetened breakfast cereals which while reaching their right audience, sweetened cereals are not as healthy as the unsweetened variety. Add fruit to cereals which would take place of the ‚Äòsweetners‚Äô.
4) If that happens to fail, be a sneak and sneak it in. Make carrot muffins with zucchini bread. Add pieces of fruit or shaved vegetables to virtually any baked dish. While dried fruit is high in sugar, it is also high in fiber so dried cranberries can be a hit. Kids love smoothies! A great way to hide fruit and vegetables is in whole-food smoothies and juices. The Sneaky Chef and Deceptively Delicious are two recently published cookbooks that offer more ideas on how to hide the healthy stuff!
5) Multivitamins are essential. In this day and age so many foods are processed so give a daily multivitamin as a safety net. Vitamins are compounds necessary in trace amounts for the normal functioning of children and adults alike.I have great respect for the longstanding relationship between humans and their natural foods. By eating whole foods (fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains, etc.), your child can get the necessary vitamins in the healthiest way. In order to see the world around us we need these vitamins to grow as they help bones and connective tissue to grow, stop us from bleeding to death, heal wounds, fight infections and cancer, and keep our teeth from falling out.As we know most preschoolers and toddlers are often picky eaters. As children‚Äôs tastes change as they grow, and they do eventually get to eating a more well-rounded diet. So vitamins (the ‚Äúsafety net‚Äù) takes the pressure off feeding issues during the primary years. You can be free to be creative about increasing whole foods in your child‚Äôs diet, knowing that vitamins are present to help your child grow strong and healthy without pressure or worry.
Now that we have mass advertising, children‚Äôs fun meals, and peer pressure makes the battle all the harder. Never push or force them, entice them, persuade them and most importantly teach them. Battle bad  nutrition. The battle should never be with your kids.  Thumbs up for organic foods and healthy children üôÇThis is interesting article. Most of people is forgetting simple, healthy and good food and changing it for junk food these days. It takes so little to change eating habits, but still most of people don‚Äôt do that‚Ä¶Great info.  I have only recently started eating healthily and all this information really is a god sent.

Basically we can eat all foods, but bear in mind that we don‚Äôt need to have it in an exaggerated ways. Of course, if you want to have your real lifetime health, just consider eating the ‚Äúwhat must‚Äù to your body such as: vegetables, fruits, coconut oil or olive oil, salmon and etc!

if you want to have your real lifetime health, just consider eating the ‚Äúwhat must‚Äù to your body such as: vegetables, fruits, coconut oil or olive oil, salmon and etc! The healthier food you consume, the happier your life will be.Aside that raw food diet is nutritious, I also consider it as my daily diet food supplement, eating fruits, lots of water, vegetables.
But i must admit that there are some foods that I realy prefer short ‚Äúcooked‚ÄùThere are giant health benefits to be gained by eating healthy portions of fresh fruit and vegetables each day. Diets high in fruit and vegetables are known to help keep our hearts healthy, and help protect us from diseases.Has anybody ever noticed that most fruits and vegetables are mostly water like humans and the earth?The last 2 year I have been saving money growing my own vegetable garden ‚Äì Each year my garden gets bigger ‚Äì I spend about $60.00 a month at a store ‚Äì my health is wonderful and I look 20 years younger. Let‚Äôs not forget that there are others as well. Gardens are a potential means to increase our confidence in food safety and security. We know where the food is coming from and all the history of plants grown in our own gardens. We know what chemicals were used, we know what pests were problems and we essentially eliminated the whole resource-gobbling transportation chain to get the food to your plate. And all that gardening is good for you. It is a great form of physical exercise, and I haven‚Äôt met a nutritionist yet who didn‚Äôt think that fresh produce was ‚Äúgood for you‚Äù too!I love this article. I have been eating more raw in the past and this last year I let it go for a while. I moved and it seemed to be hard to get my system in place again. Looking back, my gradual health problems did not start until I began consuming processed foods again. Lets face it, its easier to eat all this unhealthy prepared food than it is to prepare healthy foods on a daily basis. I got to the point to where my skin became more and more inflammed-very similar to a chronic allergic reaction. It got so bad that I literally went to the fride and cupboards on day and threw out all of the garbage and started over with a more raw-based diet. I started juicing daily, working out and drinking more water. I even did some cleansing.  Within just a few days, the itching stopped and within a month or so, my skin made a dramatic improvement. That was just 3 months ago and I continue to this day to get my ‚Äúold-young-self‚Äù back. Advice to people: Don‚Äôt get caught up on any particular ‚Äúdiet‚Äù-eat for nutrition and your body will reward you. Fresh juicing really helped me ‚Äúreset‚Äù my body and soon I starting craving good quality whole raw foods. If you feed your body what it needs, you will not feel ‚Äúdeprived‚Äù-Avoid the microwave and toxic chemicals like a plague. Is such a program good for  you? Put it this way, if a medical doctor tells me I must eat so much dairy and meat-I would consider him/her to be ignorant and untrained in basic nutrition. People must take responsibility for their own health. Let your body decide what it likes-it really knows without you even having to think about it. One thing about cost: There are so many things you can make if you have the proper tools-good juicer, blender and dehydrator. I have cut my food cost way down because I am not buying dairy or meat. I still eat seldom a little good quality meat and very little dairy. But they must be from a source I know and not from a poisonous source (like most of the supermarkets). Once you get in a habit of eating raw and preparing your meals, its really not bad, when you consider the almost immediate benefits! Don‚Äôt ecpect the people around you to understand your new eating choices, just stay focused and feed your body real food. Question everything that is considered ‚Äúfood‚Äù-just because it is on the shelf at the store, does not make it safe-be informed and try new things. Thanks again for the article! Good luck everyone!Outward appearance is not always an indicator of how healthy they may be. I think the main problem is to do with losing weight as we grow older. I am 53, and have lost 22kilos in less than 4 months. So, yes, all that weight loss and a thinner face makes me look older, but in reality, I feel 20 years younger and my agility has improved immeasurably. Another good example is that my libido and things in that department have also improved to an extent that I feel VERY youthful!Fruitarian diets are a terrible idea and will leave one significantly malnourished over the long-term, and unless you‚Äôre rapidly exercising every day, the sugar will have devastating effects. Where are you going to get enough zinc, iron, iodine, B12, and EPA/DHA? Iron from plants has very poor bioavailability. I challenge any fruitarian to get a SpectraCell test performed on them and post it to the public, they will be deficient in a variety of nutrients. The Natural Hygiene diet is an outdated and downright dangerous diet to follow. If you‚Äôre going to be raw vegan, you must follow a well-balanced diet which includes sprouts, algae‚Äôs, sea vegetables, fruits, vegetables, and sprouted nuts/seeds. I know people want to think it‚Äôs as simple as eating fruits and vegetables, but that‚Äôs not the reality. Also, the whole vegans causing no harm isn‚Äôt reality either, they are still killing a plant and new research has proven that plants can feel pain, and this is coming from a raw vegan.Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()So Joe, do you speak from experience ‚Äì Have you tried a fruitarian diet for any stretch of time?Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Raw veganism is a remarkable diet.  I stumbled upon it a few years ago when I began to incorporate juicing into my diet as part of a revitalization effort.  I remained a raw vegan for about six months.
My view about diet is that there is no perfect diet which is universal, although there may be some universal principles which may apply (such as eating clean, or `non-toxic‚Äô, for example.)
My own experience with raw veganism corresponds largely to what the good Dr. has written here.  Every department of functionality was improved ‚Äî biochemical (according to blood tests), psychological (in light of the nature of `lived-experience‚Äô), sociological (in keeping with improved mood, cognition, energy, empathy), religiousity (in light of the reduced focus on vulgar materialism and the corresponding act of opening of channels for `higher-order‚Äô transcendental experience.)
Ancient knowledge reveals that diet in a major instrument of liberation ‚Äî from suffering (dukha) in general and may contribute very substantially to happiness.
However, according to Ajurvadic thought on the matter of raw veganism, certain people fare better with it than others, depending on `type‚Äô.  There are three main types of persons.  Some may become somewhat manic or overly-talkative and hyper-energized to an unacceptable degree, for example.
Climate may also be relevant with respect to practice.  A friend who is a homesteader in central Canada where the temperature drops to 50 below zero fahrenheit at times reports to me that raw veganism does not work in the depths of winter.  On the other hand, I have read that some people in the Transcaucasis in Eurasia may live to be more than 100 years of age disease free on a raw vegan diet ‚Äî and they attribute their longevity to their diet.
My sense is that raw veganism is a powerful tool in a dietary context.  Even if one cannot stick with it for life, its periodic use for purposes of detoxification restoration, revitalization, philosophical reflection, humanization, and so on and so forth, is really rather remarkable.
Remaining raw vegan continuously for six months a year on a periodic basis would provide major benefits in every aspect of life.  Alternatively, continuous raw veganism at all times for the foreseeable is also an option, assuming one does not get a bad nutritional outcome.
I recall that when I was pursuing a raw vegan dietary regime I used to be regularly amazed by the life-restoring and world transforming results.  It vanquished pain and torpor, it performed healing miracles, it caused me to wonder how and why all people did not gravitate to this way of eating, seeing, being, knowing.
I am convinced that there is more to raw veganism than our current ways of thinking allow us to grasp.  It is a transcendentalizing diet, if you will.  We do no yet have a language which allows us to describe such a diet.  But it is possible to try it, while at the same time trying to reduce, avoid and prevent the introduction of fake and poisonous food into our bodies.
