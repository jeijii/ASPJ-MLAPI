These fortifications are used because the stripping process removes most of the iron, vitamins, zinc and magnesium from the rice. In fact, white rice is so devoid of nutrients that it does not offer the minimum nutritional requirements of the FDA.

Brown rice also contains the necessary components to stabilize digestion,  and promote proper elimination/bowel function.Unlike stripped rice, brown rice can help keep blood sugar stabilized as it releases sugars slowly and in a sustained fashion. This makes it a better option for diabetics, as compared to white rice. While studies in Asia have shown a link between the consumption of white rice and risk of type 2 diabetes, new research shows that individuals who eat at least two servings of brown rice weekly can reduce their chances of developing diabetes 2 by up to 11 percent.I personally recommend using organic wild brown rice as the best option. But, even if you don‚Äôt buy organic, just making the switch from white rice to brown rice is a great first step to a healthy diet.

You are an idiot.I visited a town in China where white rice was the main dish.  Yet I did not see anyone that was obese. I‚Äôm sure there are some, but unlike in the US where I can easily pick out someone  who is obese wherever I go (even the gym), I honestly did not come across any overweight person in the town I visited.  Hi,
I have made brown rice my staple diet for over a year now. But i realised i am experiencing a lot of flatulence. Could this be because of brown rice? I do not consume considerable amounts of  any other fibre rich foods.

Wish you a wonderful day!:)Ya, screw it ya know, just have a bowl full of multivitamins for dinner ya know‚Ä¶.. Clown Brown rice is also full of proteins if you let them sit on self long enough.

there are other factors that contribute to Asian‚Äôs fitness: genetic makeup, activities, diet. the reason why Asians aren‚Äôt fat even thought they eat white rice in a regular basis, is because like i said, their gene, Asians generally have smaller frames and don‚Äôt gain weight as easily as Caucasian or other races. and other than white rice, their diet consists of mostly healthy, unprocessed food (unlike American with McDonald pizza donuts and stuffs).
and even though white rice is bad, i‚Äôd say unless you eat like 2lbs of it everyday, there shouldn‚Äôt be a real danger. at least, it‚Äôs wayyy better than stuffs that Americans eat.my question is, are all brown rice the same? are all of them really ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù? i find a lot of brown rice brands in the market which might seem healthy but when you look at the nutrition facts and the ingredients, it‚Äôs almost like white rice: very low in fiber (1g per serving) and protein.
i often find brown rice that actually taste good, are not so good on the nutrition part. the ones that are actually high in fiber and nutrition content are the one that taste like paper and look ugly üòõ
are all brown rice really the same? do the companies process the rice and put ‚Äúbrown rice‚Äù on the package only to fool us?Actually, that‚Äôs a very common occurrence with any type of rice that has sat on the shelves for too long. A tip: when you buy rice, freeze it. It helps keep its nutrients from degrading, and it gets completely rid of any infestation possibility (the extreme cold killing anything that could have possibly hatched). When you are ready to use it, just take it out of the freezer, and cook it as you would normally (making sure to rinse it well and soak it for a while before you actually cook it), given that the freezing process does not alter the grain‚Äôs state.And it‚Äôs no secret that yes, brown rice is by far a superior choice: whole grains are always the wiser alternative.Hi,actually, flatulence can be caused by a number of things ‚Äì irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, food intolerance‚Ä¶ For example, I was having a similar problem until I cut off gluten from my diet, and my gut has been extremely healthy ever since, thus suggesting that I might have been gluten intolerant for quite a while.In other words, you might want to research your own eating habits, maybe keep a log of what you eat and note when it is that your stomach acts up.

The rest of you don‚Äôt know what you are talking about.Pingback: ()Ok first white rice is brown rice that has had the bran removed! That‚Äôs why they add ‚Äúenrich‚Äù it because it‚Äôs useless it‚Äôs an empty carb! Brown is actually worse for you IF you do NOT soak it! Rice is a seed so it has an enzyme that protects it till its time to germinate! If you eat brown rice that has not been soak the enzyme blocks nutrient absorbtion! If you soak it, then all that‚Äôs gone, the enzyme goes away because it thinks it‚Äôs time for the rice to grow, so then it actually gets more nutritious for you! After soaking brown rice is easily digestible and is full of micronutrients from the fermentation beginning! Some people actually let the rice germinate and fermente then it‚Äôs really healthy! So if you like rice but don‚Äôt want empty carbs just eat soaked brown rice! If you don‚Äôt want to soak it then just don‚Äôt eat it! I always try to soak mine for 24 hours, but I‚Äôm sure 12 is plenty! It‚Äôs not rocket science just do your research! Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Brown rice is very hard for many people to digest.White rice is better, just load it up with vegetables.Pingback: ()Pingback: ()The problem is they taste different. And I like white rice better. So, uh. Sorry, pal.Soak your brown rice overnight I do 24 hours with an acid I use lemon juice, this tells the rice (which is a seed) it‚Äôs time to germinate, so it releases the enzyme that is nothing your stomach! That enzyme is there to protect the seed till germination time. Just soak the rice then not only does it not bother your stomach, but it also has more nutritional value to it, not only but including micro nutritiants so use the water you soak it in to also cook it in! Problem solved!Not true! Brown rice is a seed, so it has a protective enzyme that will not only block nutritiant absorbtion, but will bother your stomach if you do not soak it first! Got to love science!White rice is empty f^*king calories! When you wash the starch off, all that white water you are also washing off all the ‚Äúenriched‚Äù crap that was sprayed on the rice after they took the germ and all nutritional value out of it! They spray the minerals on it, so when you wash the crap, you also wash off the minerals! If you soak brown rice overnight with an acid say lemon juice it releases the enzyme that brown rice has that not only blocks the nutritional absorbtion in your intestines, but it stops it from upsetting your tummy! Can you comprehend that! NO I did not even read this silly article, why because I already know what it says! Brown ric cost more because it‚Äôs a whole grain! Not left over crap after they took all the good parts out to feed to the farm animals! Do you see that! They don‚Äôt even feed the animals white rice! That should tell you how good it is for humans!No because they‚Äôre all broke and that‚Äôs all they can afford after being used as slaves for our Western materialize world! I‚Äôve seen people in clothing manufacturers chained to a steel frame with an IV in for fluids, because they passed out from heat and lack of drinking water! So they chain them, them being slaves and all, to metal so they can‚Äôt escape then IV some fluids then force them back to working! You think they can afford a whole grain food??? FIJUST LIKE THE SUGAR THEYVE BEEN SHOVELING DOWN OUR THROATS FOR DECADES!Basmati, brown jasmine, basmati is better,nod your homeworkers! The food industry and the government are not looking out for us! They‚Äôre the ones who got two generations hooked on sugar! Why because it‚Äôs cheap! They could care less about us, they just want every penny we make! Also soak your brown rice overnight in lemon juice or other acid, it kills the enzyme that blocks nutritiant absorbtion and makes the rice more nutritious! Plus it won‚Äôt bother your stomach! Don‚Äôt believe what you read on a label, plus most rice naked as brown looks white and pale, why because it‚Äôs still not the whole grain! They‚Äôre scamming you! If the nutrients are not there neither is the bran! Brown rice contains a lot more than white if it‚Äôs real whole brown rice! Not the white washed version that you can‚Äôt even see the difference in color! On the high energy food you are right! Sit on your ares and eat huge amounts of rice you get a big arse! If that‚Äôs all you do is sit on your atse don‚Äôt eat rice!
