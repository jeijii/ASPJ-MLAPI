michiganI like chocolates and I am so happy that you included it here as something good for the body.  Thanks for your post. I really need to read something like this to remind me to eat right.chocolates are good for health.are they?
what about dark chocolates.they also good for health?Actually dark chocolate is better for you than milk chocolate. Dark chocolate contains a good amount of antioxidants.I am not a doctor by any means. But I have done extensive research on health. Brands you should stay away from are the most commonly heard of brands you will find at stores. Brands like Nestl√©, Hershey‚Äôs, Wonka‚Ä¶ones like that. If you look on the ingredients of their products they contain things in them like caranuba wax‚Ä¶I have products I use on my car to detail it that contain caranuba wax. Not something a human should consume. And almost all of them contain high fructose corn syrup‚Ä¶which they mentioned in the article to take in natural sugars‚Ä¶high fructose corn syrup is a processed sugar.i Love dark chocolate who dosen‚Äôt ?The imformation provided here is excellent! I cant wait to re-visit the food store to get the correct food I should have been eating all along!I enjoyed reading this article. I am a college student and my final paper this semester for my English class was to argue how healthy foods are better for your brain and are just plain better for you period. I wanted to add as well that there are foods that also improve sex life. I know this may seem immature but your brain is an amazing organ that really does need the proper fuel for all aspects of life from healthy memory to a healthy sex life. Black beans are also a great aphrodisiac on top of being good for a source of folic acid. So those who are trying to conceive, it is a good source of food both both parties. Oysters, as slimy as they are a great source of healthy sex/brain development. They are packed full of complex sugars and proteins and are loaded with zinc which is a key ingredient to testosterone production which helps sexual performance for both genders.I have an urgent need to improve my declining brain power. I believe it is caused mostly by my low blood pressure condition. Is there some medication or vitamins or food/fruits that can correct my blood pressure permanently?
