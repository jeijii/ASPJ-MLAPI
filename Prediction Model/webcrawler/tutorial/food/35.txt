Is there a simpler one?I disagree about the mercury warning with mackerel, pilchards and salmon as they have been proven to be the best source of healthy fish, only long lived fish such as shark,octopus and squid hang around long enough to get tainted with mercury. Also,we lived on meat and veg for 5‚Äô000‚Äô000 years without cancer, CVD and diabetes, why do people choose veggie now?, even animals eat animals, as they would eat you if you fell dead in a forest without being discovered.Thanks for the nice information.
