Started taking them 2011I’m not crazy about supplements, so I just drink kefir and other fermented goodies.  I do see an improvement in my resistance to a whole host of illnesses which I used to be vulnerable to.  Everyone else in my household gets sick, I get passed over – time and time again.  I tell them it’s my diet, but they’re not biting.  Too bad.  Being sick is no fun.PS:  over the years I’ve become conditioned to enjoy the flavors and textures of healthy foods.  That’s the key – remaking healthy choices into healthy pleasures.I suggest that if you like spicy foods you learn to enjoy kimchi, and if you like sweets you learn to make your own fermented fruit.  Eating your probiotics can become a true pleasure, and one that isn’t dependent on any one source of packaged, processed pills.
