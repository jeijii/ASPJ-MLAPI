        We hear a lot about the importance of eating food that’s organically grown and free of pesticides and other harmful toxins.  That’s often where the conversation stops.  However, should we also give consideration to the cookware we use to prepare the food we eat?  Of course nobody wants to eat food with a high aluminum content, but what about preparing food in aluminum cookware? Does that present safety concerns?  What about stainless steel cookware?  Much research indicates that we need to be as deliberate in the cookware we use as we are in the foods we consume.          Exposure to, or ingestion of, aluminum can negatively affect the nervous and skeletal system; it’s even thought to be linked to Alzheimer’s disease.  Despite this, foods are commonly stored or prepared in aluminum containers which present leaching dangers. This is especially true with acidic and salty foods; citric acid in particular is known to leach aluminum from cookware.     Coffee is not generally known to contain aluminum naturally but when researchers at the Department of Agroenvironmental Chemistry and Plant Nutrition at Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague brewed coffee in aluminum containers, they discovered it to produce detectable levels of aluminum in the coffee.     It’s also important to note that sometimes foods may be prepared in aluminum containers before it even reaches you.  The Department of Food Hygiene and Control at Egypt’s Mansoura University found levels of aluminum in milk stored in aluminum containers (likely at the production level).     Boiling water in aluminum cookware prior to use will greatly decrease the amount of aluminum leached, but the best choice is to simply avoid aluminum cookware altogether.     Stainless steel is used in home and commercial cookware but, like aluminum, stainless is readily attacked by acids, particularly at cooking temperatures, and its components can be released into food. The Division of Science, Engineering and Technology at Pennsylvania State found that stainless utensils exposed to even mildly acidic conditions at boiling temperature caused nickel, chromium, and iron corrosion.  Research conducted at Texas Tech University College of Human Sciences concluded with similar determinations.     Although it does not completely solve the problem, the Hôpital Edouard Herriot in France recommends that individuals with nickel sensitivity should use nickel-free stainless steel.     Perhaps one of the most common types of cookware is that which is non-stick.  If you’ve ever used sub-par cookware, you probably know how easy it is for some cooking surfaces to cause burnt food to lock on with cement-like attachment. This is a pain to clean up and it ruins the food.  Non-stick cookware is designed to prevent this problem, but it also introduces new safety concerns.    Perfluorinated compounds (PFC’s) are synthetic compounds used to manufacture non-stick surfaces. However, both the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and the New York State Department of Health have found that these compounds can remain on the surface of non-stick cookware and be released into food.      Why should you avoid PFC’s?  Well, when they accumulate in the body, negative effects to the reproductive system, brain, and liver are all possibilities.  Some PFCs are even considered to be human carcinogens.  In 2012, Greece’s Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at Harokopio University found a correlation between the use of non-stick cookware and colorectal cancer.     Ceramic cookware isn’t as inherently dangerous as the other previously mentioned cookware except for when it’s coated in glaze that contains lead.  In some parts of South America it can be common to grind spices in cookware glazed with lead.  The grinding action, or presence of acidic foods, can result in lead contamination.     A slightly outside-the-box option to consider would be to eat more raw foods. Raw foods contain more live enzymes and nutrients than their cooked counterparts. Depending on your dietary choices, however, raw is not always an option. Safe alternatives to questionable cookware do exist but it’s necessary to seek them out on purpose and be an educated consumer.  A company that I am completely unaffiliated with, Ozeri, produces a quality line of ceramic non-stick pans that are free of PFC’s and will not release toxic metals.

I would definitely like to know which cookware to purchase but after all these years it’s sounding as though I may not have anything inside of me left to possibly save!What about cast iron?Cast iron is great.  Look for it in thrift shops and try to find the old ones that are made in the USA.  I do that because many items made in Asia are made with recycled toxic materials.We use scanpan which is great. Non toxic and easy to clean. We buy ours for a slight discount on Ebay.Concord Eco Friendly makes a nice ceramic set. No PTFE chemicals used.Great info Kristin, thanks for sharing!have you done any research on Ozeri cookware? because its pretty bad dude..What do you dislike about Ozeri?its cheap cookware make in china by a Chinese company, the nonstick ceramic will scratch within the first couple of months (2-3) of use… I’m sure it will leak toxic chemicals in to food… sounds pretty toxic to me.Bummer! So many good reviews. What do you use instead?Good call!my husband and I just got rid or all our non stick cookware and wants to buy ceramic instead and we are thinking of buying Dr. Mercola’s ceramic cookware. Anyone who has any take or feedback on this?Pingback: ()I tried a ceramic wok once, some ‘Green’ thing, I forget the full name. It was hopeless at non-stick and soon got scratched to bits, even using wooden utensils. Utterly useless. Hard for me to believe any other brands would be better.Pingback: ()Pingback: ()wow, interesting post to read. I was only researching heavy metals and their effect on humans when i saw this. it only confirms what i discovered 2 months ago. I only discovered the heavy metal poisoning 2 months ago and now I use titanium cookware from Saladmaster. The sets are not cheap initially, but they do the job!  The cookware is made to a standard not a price. No bad comments about it and its a lifetime guarantee. If you want cookware that does not leach toxins and chemicals into your food and enables you to cook at low heat, hence preserving, on average, 93% of the nutrition in your food, you need Saladmaster. I did not just buy it for myself, I joined them in letting people know about it. You can contact me on  for more information.Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Cast iron is generally considered a very healthy material, and requires minimal cleaning (no soap, just salt, etc.) once you have seasoned it; but most of the market is dominated by pre-seasoned cookware, meaning it has had potentially toxic GMO and toxic chemical-laden oils applied/sprayed on the cookware.  Raw iron rusts very easily so it is somewhat understandable as to why companies want to ‘seal’ it to prevent rust that might deter buyers.  But rust is relatively easy to scrub off in preparation for the pan’s owner to season it with the fat of their choice.  But the ‘sealants’ manufacturers are using these days are extraordinarily difficult to remove.  Granted, some of the allegedly ‘unseasoned’ pans coming from China have been sprayed with unknown lacquers, waxes and who-knows-what, making the danger even worse as one has no idea what kind of chemical one is working with.  One of the major, well-known brands here in the USA used to claim that the oil they used was certified kosher, but that is no longer the case.  For over 5 years now the trend seems to be secrecy – we as consumers are NOT provided with any information whatsoever as to what was applied to the surface of cookware we intend to use for FOOD preparation, to be consumed by our children and ourselves.  Thankfully, there are smaller companies out there to provide a much-needed and requested product – you just have to search for them.  Finex, for example, produces a high-quality line of cast iron cookware – and more importantly, they actually specify what they use to coat their cookware – organic flaxseed oil.  Keep searching and remember to voice your concerns!Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()
