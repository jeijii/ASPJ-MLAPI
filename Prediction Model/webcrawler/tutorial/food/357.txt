    Soy milk, soy cheese, soy crisps—there is a booming market for vegan soy-based foods and a lot of supposed health authorities touting its alleged benefits. What if soy was actually a wolf in sheep’s clothing and only called a health food because its supply was so abundant? What if  as the marketing wizards tell us? As it turns out, that’s exactly what the data suggests. Let’s pull back the curtain and shine a light of truth on soy.        Soy is said to benefit everything from heart disease to menopause.

Fermented soy milk, tofu, miso, soy sauces, tempeh, and natto can actually offer a lot of health benefits.        Fermentation reduces enzyme inhibitors and makes soy’s nutrients more available.

Most soybeans today are also  and sprayed with pesticides. This introduces a plethora of toxins that block the healthy absorption of essential minerals.    As mentioned earlier, soy is in everything. Switch to a whole foods diet and eliminate processed food, as much as you can. Watch out for products that contain lecithin, , or “natural flavors” as that’s often a code word for soy.

Not convinced soy needs to be avoided by males.Why does soy need to be avoided by males? I don’t drink it a lot, but every so often I will buy a half gallon of soy milk from whole foods. When I drink it I feel great. I feel full and satisfied. I wish I could say the same for organic cow’s milk. I can not believe I used to drink that sh##. If I even attempt to drink it I feel bloated, stuffed up and I get tired and irritable.Really great post
