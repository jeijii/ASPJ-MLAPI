  Royal Jelly is unique  and its health benefits are tremendous in bees and in humans. This creamy secretion, produced by worker bees, is fed to bee larvae to develop them into workers. However, if higher amounts of royal jelly are fed to a select few larvae, a metamorphosis occurs. They grow to be 40% larger than their sisters, live up to 40 times longer, and eventually develop into queen bees.        Royal jelly also offers a wide range of benefits to humans. As an all-natural super food, it is rich in protein, B vitamins, and a litany of other vital nutrients and minerals. One of these ingredients, acetylcholine, is believed to  and to improve memory. Royal jelly is the only compound in nature that contains pure acetylcholine.    This natural compound was actually the first neurotransmitter ever discovered. It exists throughout the nervous system, the spinal cord, and the brain. Its purpose is to facilitate message transmissions between nerve cells and to regulate memory. When levels of this neurotransmitter are optimal, thought becomes more fluid, cognitive function is enhanced, and memory is improved.      The belief that RJ can enhance acetylcholine levels and improve mental function appears to have been corroborated to some degree by a recent Japanese study. After six months of constantly ingesting royal jelly, humans experienced improvements in glucose tolerance, mental health, and erythropoiesis.       Organic royal jelly’s health benefits also extend to the skin. Royal jelly contains many of the vitamins and  and acids that stimulate the production of collagen, necessary for skin renewal. Many women have reported that consuming royal jelly for only 30 days helped their skin become healthier, firmer, and visibly younger in appearance.      Other Japanese studies seem to indicate that the active ingredient in RJ, Royalisin, has the ability to fight redness and to reduce the amount of time needed for skin abrasions and cuts to heal. The full extent of how RJ actually accomplishes its work continues to be the subject of ongoing inquiry.     GMO’s, radiation exposure, and synthetic chemicals may diminish the health benefits of any natural substance. This is especially true for a natural compound as astonishingly unique as royal jelly. It is recommended to use organic RJ that produced by honeybees in organic environments that specifically are void of radiation, , and synthetic fertilizers.
