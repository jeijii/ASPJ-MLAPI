  There’s a lot of stigma about eating at fast food restaurants – it’s unhealthy, , it’s bad for the environment – the list goes on and on. In many cases, this bad reputation is more than merited; yet, there are still some important misconceptions about fast food, including who they’re really hurting the most.            Many people believe that fast-food dining, especially the drive-thru variety, is primarily eaten by low-income families. Newly published findings, however, suggest otherwise.  In fact, these findings have shown that it’s actually middle-class Americans who are the greatest consumers of quick, cheap, and greasy fast food. Using data sets collected from 5,000 US citizens, researchers at UC Davis were able to compare factors such as household income, gender, race, and education with regards to meal choices.    In many ways, the group’s findings were fairly predictable. For example, as household income increased, so too did the frequency of visits to full table service sit-down restaurants. Changes in rate of fast food consumption, on the other hand, were more surprising. In stark contrast to their original expectations, fast food intake actually increased alongside household income by up to 60 thousand dollars per year. Once families had crossed this income mark, average fast food consumption rates began to decline.    It would appear that the financial savings home-cooked meals offer is reason enough for many lower-income families to avoid eating out altogether. For middle-class families, the convenience of a quick, low-hassle meal seems to hold more appeal. By avoiding cooking their own meals at home, many people who choose fast-food options are at a greater risk for experiencing a decline in health, something that could eventually lead to financial stress. This is why eating fresh, mostly raw organic foods is crucially important for supporting health on all fronts!    Regardless of busy schedules or budgetary considerations, there’s really no good reason to regularly consume fast food. Here are some tips to work around time constraints while reducing the incidence of driving through a fast food joint:  What do you do when you find yourself wanting to grab something quick?
