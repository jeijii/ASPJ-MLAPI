    It’s a fairly common, and perhaps trendy, habit for some people to bash large, big-box, retail stores.  We currently have an ongoing example of this in Houston right now.  The general complaint is that these companies are simply tools of mass distribution, over consumption, and real life examples of buying habits gone haywire.  Quite frankly, there is, arguably, a lot of truth in those criticisms.          What many people may not realize though, is that their “local”, large, we-got-it-all grocery store is a very similar shopping experience, constructed in similar fashion, and operated the same way.    Think about it, for the weekly or monthly supply of consumables, the grocery store is where most people run.  Food, cleaning supplies, household product, toiletries, the pharmacy…  has it all and can be that convenient one stop shop.    But, does it really provide the best options?  Jennie Wilson, consultant, researcher, and author of the blog, “Simple Food Remedies,” says no.  I recently saw this video in which she breaks down the concept of the large, corporate, production-heavy-presentation grocery store and makes the assertion that they are simply part of the processed, no-nutrient food problem    It’s hard to argue with what she says. A walk down the aisles of most grocery stores will present you with mountains of processed food, all beautifully displayed in nice packaging designed to stimulate your visual senses in many different ways.  However, what they lack is a focus, that extends beyond surface buzzwords, of the foods nutritional value.  And, certainly, most also lack the actual nutritional value itself.    The produce section usually has the least adulterated food, but even then if the options aren’t organic or locally grown, they are less than ideal.    The solution to the problem is simple, buy and consume real, whole, organic food.  Find local farmers who are producing food, naturally, right in your area, and support them. The website  lists farmers market locations across the country.  This can be very helpful, not only to find the market closest to you, but also while traveling.  Seize the opportunity to visit a local farmer’s market on your away-from-home vacation, it can be a real treat to experience locally grown food away from your locale.

Awareness of what is available and what you are buying is the key to getting the healthiest food for your body. Thanks for the post!My wife and I are shocked at the exponential amount of toxic fragrances floating in the air in grocery stores. Those that are big enough even make showcase stacks of air fresheners and fabric softeners packages in the wider aisles. When the food is stocked in the back, it gets exposed to those chemicals. Some stores we can’t even use their plastic bags, or buy certain products because of their proximity to those poisons. Yet, TV ads abound with Glades and Febreeze, deodorants, colognes, perfumes, hailing them as bringing this great experience in the home or to cover odors. Lastly, more and more clothing, household items, electronics, and other products contain dyes and substances that are so toxic we have to return them to the store because my wife gets sick around it. She has developed chemical sensitivities and can’t even enjoy a concert or any other cultural event indoors because everybody and their mother splashes heavy perfumes. I think whatever eugenics may be happening, companies creating perfumes and other fragrances are the ones to pay attention to. One more thing: when a company moves its operations to another country, are their products subject to the same regulations as when they were in the USA or Canada concerning the use of toxic chemicals? Does the explosion of China’s manufacturing power create a loophole for the unmonitored use and experimentation of deadly chemicals?Thanks!Andre
