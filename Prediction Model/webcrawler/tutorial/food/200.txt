        If genetically-modified and chemically-laden produce can cause adverse health effects in adults, imagine what it can do to an infant. Yet, many people who will buy their own organic produce also reach for  conventional baby food when shopping for their little ones. Thankfully, making your own organic baby food is simple and can be quite enjoyable.        To make the best organic baby food, you will need to start with the best ingredients. If you can, grow it yourself. But if not, be sure to purchase the right produce. Buy local, organic produce whenever possible in order to maximize the nutritional benefits and freshness.     Local foods aren’t only more fresh, they support local organic farmers who are bucking the traditional system in an effort to bring you healthy food. If local organics aren’t an option, find a grocery store with a good selection of organic produce. When you get it home, no matter where it’s from, wash it well.    The ingredients for your homemade organic baby food are simple: fresh produce. Some fruits and vegetables will need a little liquid added. If this is the case, choose breast milk in the event you are nursing. If not, you may use water.     If the fruit or veggie you are using is hard (potatoes, apples, etc.), cook them just long enough to soften. Puree your produce, adding a little liquid if necessary. You don’t need the fancy baby food machine many retailers are hawking right now; a blender or food processor will work fine. With softer vegetables, like cooked sweet potatoes, even a fork will get the job done.    When it comes to fruits and vegetables, fresh is best. The sooner you can get your baby food made and fed to your child the better. As produce is stored, the level of nitrates within grows. Either plan to make only what your child will eat in one setting or consider freezing what you don’t use. Ice cube trays are a great idea for freezing small portions.  Here are a few additional tips and tricks when making your own organic baby food:  Preschoolers who eat a conventional diet have up to six times greater concentrations of pesticide residue in their bodies. Infants are even now being born with GMO toxins in their blood. We owe it to these children to take control of their health. We can’t rely on the food companies to do it for us.

What age and amount of organic food is healthy? versus only breastfeeding. You will want to talk to your pediatrician about your specific child and specific situation. However, it is my understanding that generally speaking breast-feeding is good for at least a year if not longer, and most people do not start introducing other food until at least six months old. Again, talk to your pediatrician and verify that for your child.These are some great tips! I especially like the freezing in the ice cube tray idea, perfect proportions for the little one!
