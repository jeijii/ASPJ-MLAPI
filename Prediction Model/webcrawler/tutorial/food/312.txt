  Pans with a non-stick coating are convenient but new research suggests that the chemical used for the coating is  and exposure on any level could prove dangerous to brain health, the reproductive system, and immune system.        DuPont, the chemical engineering giant, is responsible for the perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) used to make . Federal regulators linked the chemical to birth defects and cancer, and these regulators also accused DuPont of hiding these hazard reports for decades. This caused an uproar and forced DuPont to phase out production of the chemical in 2006. Regardless, PFOA has already infiltrated millions of homes; resulting in detectable amounts of the compound in the blood of nearly every American. It’s even been found in polar bears in the Arctic.    A new Environmental Working Group (EWG) report suggests that there is no safe level of exposure to the chemical in non-stick coatings, categorizing PFOA in the same league as asbestos and . This new report is supported by studies from the University of Massachusetts (UMASS) and Harvard University — studies that suggest blood levels of PFOA 400 times lower than the EPA’s current level could still cause adverse effects.    There are some natural, safer alternatives to Teflon that you should be aware of. If you currently own a non-stick pan, throw them out immediately. Replace all non-stick bakeware with glass, and choose steel and cast iron for other cooking needs. Rely on , like olive oil and , to provide a natural non-stick surface for your cookware. Ideally, the majority of your diet should be uncooked and raw, meaning you shouldn’t have to worry too much about whether or not your food is sticking to cookware.

GHC understands it is a tough economy and is trying to help us out in more unique ways.  🙂True…but lets not confuse the issue with facts (?).What about the new non-PFOA “green” cookware on the market?I’ve always hated Teflon. There’s nothing like good old quality cast iron- just keep your pans well-seasoned with a light coating of olive oil….never a problem. Real cast iron is SO superior….food tastes better; cooks faster…and if need be, you can scrub it!I bought several ceramic coated skillets recently.  They are supposed to be earth friendly and safe.  Many older people used teflon and lived into their 90’s, I was always told it was inert, and when scratched bad enough throw out when aluminum was exposed underneath.That’s true- my mother’s 90, and she’s used Teflon for decades…and still does. Then again, Eubie Blake smoked since he was 6, and lived to be 99. Sometimes, genetics and other factors can overcome the things we do to ourselves- Then again, the older generations grew up with better food and more natural conditions; they’re stronger. Half the guys I grew up with (by contrast) didn’t make it to 50. (Literally HALF the people I grew up with! 😮 )Good point, Laura and Jay!  We also understood that Teflon needed to be thrown out when badly scratched, and don’t think using them killed any of us.  I love the ceramic skillets and love my iron skillets, Visionware and Corningware too, but if I want to cook an egg (other than boiled) ceramic is the way to go.  My forebears lived nice long lives and ate salted meat everyday (another good example).  Different lifestyles though than today: they worked hard eking out a living and didn’t have sit down jobs…I don’t know, Jay.   Should you switch to using coconut oil that takes high heat instead of olive oil on your cast iron?   I never heat up my cold expeller pressed olive oil.  It undergoes a chemical change heated up that isn’t healthy, is my understanding.Dunno, Robin- I doubt that there’s anything that DOESN’T undergo a chemical change when heated. My ancestors all lived on olive oil (We’re Italian…) and they all lived into their 80’s and 90’s and were very healthy (My mother is 90…she came over and pruned some my trees yesterday! :D) so I can’t say that I “buy” any of the “scientific” claptrap. Just look at how they did 180* flop on butter and eggs and salt and cholesterol! I tend to trust what I’ve seen with my own eyes much more than what the white-coat priests say….. (Admittedly though, I eat very little fried food- so I doubt it matters)Can’t argue with my Italian friends about olive oil, then 🙂  Totally agree with you about butter (altho husband is lactose intolerant so had to switch to coconut oil), eggs, salt and cholesterol:  I didn’t listen to the experts then either and of course we were right all along (i.e., eggs are a “perfect food,” again, to us, they always were).  I believe the health of a whole generation of Americans was ruined by the low-fat diet, and the white-coats are STILL trying to promote it!   I understand trans fats are going to be replaced with GMO soy oil:  so we are wise to continue to avoid fried food.GMO soy oil?! Yikes! I KNEW there had to be an ulterior motive to their sudden “change of heart”- just as the move to vilify butter et al was largely to drive the small local producers out of business.  My modus operandi has always been to take whatever “they” say, and completely ignore it; and to believe that the diametric opposite is usually the truth. My bro-in-law was put on a “low fat, low cholesterol diet” many years ago; and given p;ills to lower his cholesterol…and guess what? He just had a triple bypass!I know, right?   I’m not sure the trans fat wouldn’t be healthier than the GMO soy oil that is replacing it.  They grow acres and acres of soy here in North Alabama where I live.  GMO Soy and GMO cotton.  Now we know what they are going to do with all that soy…shudder.
Your poor brother!  Hope his surgery went as well as can be expected.  Makes me angry; didn’t have to be that way.  But people trust their doctors.  I don’t trust them at all.  Except for my physical therapists.  I like them a lot:  they keep me moving and don’t try to market drugs to me.Thanks, Robin.Ditto about doctors! I stay away from ’em. Haven’t been to one for over 30 years (except for eye docs, because of a condition I was born with)- and I seem to be healthier than anyone….I’m glad that they only grow tobacco here in southern KY. It sure beats anything GMO- I don’t even want to be around anything GMO. It really brings home what Jesus said about the end times being “Like the days of Noah”- In the days of Noah, everything “was corrupt”- and with this GMO crapola, and the way they’re mixing up all the genes of plants and animals; and the way such things spread and drown out the natural things, everything sure is becoming corrupt!My native American friends consider tobacco to be a very sacred plant!  I would love to just once walk into a tobacco barn and have the smell knock me down like I’ve heard it will do, just for the experience of it. I bet working with it in the fields is a nightmare, though.  Very strong medicine.   🙂  The native Americans also have a 4,000 year old prophecy about people starving to death although they eat and eat and eat.  A perfect description of what I see happening in America now as obese people eat and eat and eat because their poor bodies are not being nourished by the adulterated and over-processed foods they consume…  People seem to think the FDA is working for them.  The FDA is in direct collusion with food manufacturers and are not working for us at all imho…In Italy, everyone smokes….but not 4 packs a day. In moderation- and they don’t get all the diseases and side-effects that Americans seem to get- They live to be very old. I believe tobacco can actually be beneficial in moderation. I tried explaining it to someone once, who believes in vaccinations [UHHGG!!] I said “If you believe that injecting poisons and diseases into the bloodstream can be beneficial, why couldn’t tobacco and nicotine be, even if in high concentrations they may be “poisons”? But he just couldn’t grasp the concept…..I agree, I am much more frightened of vaccines than cigarette smoke. More and more often I am talking to people who have had vaccines and then developed horrible, expensive-to-treat health problems right afterward.  I’m afraid Government-run healthcare is going to result in MANDATORY vaccines for all of us, or we won’t be able to work, etc.  I had to get 2 rounds of measles shots in 1992 in order to attend community college, even though I already had gotten measles in 1969!  I already had an immunity to measles, and should have been able to be blood tested to prove that and get an exemption…
Some of us think this is related to Agenda 21 world population control efforts…One used to hear old doctors (the ones who are dead now) say that they have never seen a case of cancer in an unvaccinated person. The immediate effects of the vaccines can be bad enough- but a lot of their effects (like cancer) may not appear till 20 or 30 years down the road- and then the person and the medical establishment don’t connect them to the vaccine they had when they were 7. Yeah…forced vaccinations- Let’s face it- if we want to maintain any semblance of freedom in our lives, we’re going to have to leave this country. The noose is tightening every day- we’ve already lost most of our freedoms; and one day we will not be able to leave. Find a nice out-of-the-way third-world country or far flung island….’cause the “First world” has gone nuts. (Canada, Australia, Europe are all just as bad/worse than the US)Oh, By-the-way, living in tobacco country as i now do (former NYer…) I can tell you that the smell in a tobacco barn doesn’t knock you down (My neighbors all grow tobacky)- it is a very pleasant, earthy, wholesome smell though- but quite mild. I helped a neighbor “strip tobacco” [pick and sort the leaves off the plants and compress into bales) when I first moved here- wore gloves…not a problem at all- although I just about died from the boredom/monotony! :D)I couldn’t agree with your more 🙂 When I argue with my friends who trust their doctors and take every prescription drug available I tell them you are making a mistake not treating your ailments naturally because the side effects of these drugs will bite you in the butt later on, so many years away no one will ever associate that drug use with health problems you will have later.  The very definition of “a perfect crime,” imho.  I told a doctor once that I believed pharmaceutical drugs were poisonous and for people who didn’t want to change their lifestyles (looking at you, diabetes sufferers).   His nurse looked like I had slapped her in the face.   Not sure if it was because I was on to them or if it truly had never occurred to her that pharms are toxic poisons!  I think it may have been the latter.  Have you see the whooping cough vaccine commercial where the grandma holding her new grandbaby turns into a frightening looking wolf?  What the commercial doesn’t tell us about is how sick grandma may get after taking that vaccine; forget about the risk to the baby…
Around here folks that can afford it are buying property and retiring in Costa Rica.Have you read the book “Dead Doctors Don’t Lie”?  You would enjoy it.Good to know! 😉  I always loved the smell of tobacco.  Smoked 2 packs a day for 22 years but put them down over 20 years ago, cold turkey.  First 3 days were the worse of my life lol.    Must still be more cost effective to do tobaccy by hand especially in a small operation.  I remember the monotony of farm work very well…  Butter beans were the worse because they are such a low growing plant.  Backbreaking labor.  Peanuts were the easiest:  weather was cooler in the early fall and plants were pulled up by the roots and stacked on wooden shocks to dry.  Ah, the good old days when times were hard (mid-1970s 🙂Now, that is FUNNY, Keith, I don’t care who you are!  That actually happened to a friend of mine:  $2K of commercial quality cookware stolen from a house she was in the process of moving out of… she was devastated, as I would have been.I had a hair analysis test done some years back and one of the standouts in the report was very high levels of titaniam which I found bizarre. I researched the element and found it is used in some teflon coating. I threw away that frypan and now use an iron frypan.If Du-Pont was found to have fudged the studies on the health risk of teflon to the public they should be sued (like billions) to go to help pay the health care costs of governments to help with unspecified health burden from people who cooked with teflon for yearsThis Teflon myth has been going around for years but never proven. Unless you are using a blow torch to it, it is perfectly safe for you. In fact, if you take a blow torch to any metal it will be toxic and cause toxic fumes. This is nothing but trickery and invented false facts for makers of cast iron cookware.Even if what you say were true, it doesn’t negate the fact that Teflon just plain sucks! You can’t scrub Teflon; and properly seasoned cast iron is more non-stick than Teflon…and stays that way forever.gary you are a disinformation idiot, jump off a bridge
