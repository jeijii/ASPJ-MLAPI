          Unfortunately,  modern farming has fully embraced the use of harmful pesticides and herbicides to control unwanted critters and weeds.  have largely been responsible for accomplishing the task but the  agricultural industry has more recently started a biological warfare campaign against insects with an organism known as Bacillus thuringiensis, or the Bt toxin.            Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacteria that produces proteins which are toxic to insects. Bt’s extreme toxicity comes at no surprise. It’s in the same family of bacteria as B. anthracis, which causes anthrax, and B. cereus, which causes food poisoning.     Bt is toxic to many of the insects that can disrupt a farming operation. It’s widely used as a biological pesticide and, in fact, Bt is the most widely used biological pesticide in the world. Bt application can happen one of two ways — Bt can be sprayed on crops or it can be added to the DNA of genetically modified crops. Neither method is positive for health or society, but the second is quite interesting in that it actually embeds a self-contained pesticide within the crop. If a bug eats corn that contains Bt, the bug dies — simple. In the United States, Bt use is widely used on corn, cotton, and potatoes, among other crops, and it’s been pushed as a less dangerous alternative to harsh chemical pesticides.     Perhaps part of the reason for the push is that Bt can be cheaply produced. This has lead to a peanut gallery of industry yes men who are eager to chant, “it’s safe, it’s safe!” despite a widely held belief that the safety of Bt has not been verified.  In fact, many experts believe that Bt is not safe at all.    Bt does not kill insect larvae by smothering them with love and hugs. Bt is an aggressive toxin that damages cell membranes and kills insects by, literally, making their stomach burst. This has caused some researchers to examine the negative effects Bt toxin may inflict on human health… and the negative effects are many. Bt’s aggressive mechanism harms the digestive system by effectively attacking normal gut cells thereby burning holes in the intestines. This can cause problems such as . Even worse, Bt doesn’t exit your body with the unused remnants of the food it entered with.    Research has shown that the Bt toxin persists in the gastrointestinal tract of human-flora-associated rats weeks after exposure.  Research has shown that Bt has a toxic effect on the lungs and other organs.  In rare cases, Bt can even wreak havoc on the eyes, causing severe irritation and even blindness.     Exposure to Bt is a major problem for agricultural workers who handle chemicals that contain Bt. In a study that evaluated greenhouse workers, it was found that nearly half had Bt in their fecal samples.  One of the biggest problems with occupational Bt exposure is that, despite  causing serious lung damage, it does not irritate the airway when it’s inhaled. It’s been reported that many people who are subject to occupational exposure do not wear protective masks.     If Bt is the most widely used biopesticide in the agricultural industry,  does that mean it’s found in the food we eat?  Yes, it means exactly that. If you’re eating  or non-organic food, there’s a good chance  you’re consuming Bt. Research has repeatedly confirmed that Bt insecticide residue can remain on fresh fruits and vegetables.      Unfortunately, Bt toxin exposure is not limited to raw fruits and vegetables and you can’t wash it off. In 2006, researchers found the Bt toxin in pasteurized milk, ice cream, juice, and green-tea, suggesting that the  lingers through multiple stages of food production.  Additionally, GMO foods are digested more slowly and when they contain Bt, the sustained exposure puts the digestive system at risk for additional damage.     Because of Bt’s relation to B. cereus, an organism frequently responsible for food poisoning, it too has been fingered as a potential source of food poisoning. After analyzing over 49,000 food samples, the Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research found that when B. cereus is present, it’s often because of Bt.     Bt helps to perpetuate another major problem — the development of   resistant organisms.  Resistance is an inevitable and unstoppable evolutionary response to stress. The insecticides of today are not the insecticides of yesterday. Newer, stronger stuff needs to be used to do the job and, regardless of the effort, superbugs continue to evolve to stay ahead of the curve, this is incredibly bad. Researchers at the Department of Entomology and Nematology at the University of  Florida warn that effective pesticides are limited and should be reserved for emergency situations such as an unexpected pest population outbreak. They should not be used as standard protocol — which, presently, is exactly how they are used.  The declining bee population is another major issue which many scientists link directly to GMO foods and the Bt toxin. Without bees, our future does not look bright.    Let’s be very clear — Bt toxin is an aggressive, toxic poison. It kills bugs dead and it kills them with an angry vengeance. Regardless of the propaganda  slang by the biopesticide industry, research and common sense both indicate that Bt is not at all good for your health. Detox your body from GMO’s today and do what you can to stop Monsanto from killing our ecosystem and food supply!

I learned a lot from the information ! Does someone know where my company could get ahold of a blank a form version to complete ?Pingback: ()BT is the most widely used pesticide in ORGANIC farming. The more organic food you eat, the more exposure you get.That being said, it really is irrelevant since vertebrates lack the ability to metabolise it.Well said.
(Funny how someone calls this ‘junk science’ (pot-kettle!) yet cannot come up with a comprehensive scientific rebuttal of what you are saying).Pingback: ()Thank youBacteria is organic….p.s there are plenty of toxins that are organic…But please keep buying organic?Well this BT toxin aka bacteria is the kind that eats holes in the intestine, so yea have some crazy bacteria that eats holes in your delicate digestive system. You cannot call that organic just like you can’t call bubonic plague organic.Please  stop your nonsense, you can do that with ignorant folks  ….. Wm Vazquez ceo Sun & Earth Microbiology.   There get a better understanding….I live bacteria  ,  BT isn’t eating anything in a human body …it will be quickly killed by acids , encymes, etc …. now it may be able to stop the spread of mosquitoes that can kill humans …..Wrong, the bacteria is designed to eat holes in the intestinal walls and it’s happened to me when I ate fruit sprayed with BT toxin, the other thing is that BT cannot be washed off.I hope your children eat a ton of it and suffer for it.Garrett your a jerk….you will never have any ….Where does that say it’s not safe?Maybe you can inform us.The BT punches holes in the intestines and also other organs. I was exposed April 13, 2016 and my hands are full of holes. It is interesting how new psych diseases are being created which coincidently mimic the symptoms of exposure. It is also interesting how much internet control is going on with respect to thus issue. The GI issues are horrific with white or bloody stools, bloating, gas, passing solid food, vomiting, weight swing followed by weight loss, movement in the abdomen, and diarreah. Then there is the hair loss, yellow nails, temperature swings, loss of teeth, white tongue, and headaches. The Doctors have sent me home to die. Seems counterproductive to poison healthy productive members of society. Who will buy the poisoned food when everybody is dying?That it is…as a spray, not as a gene that constantly reproduces the toxin while in the GI tract of a host.  That is the difference:  Constant toxin production that clears the Gastric and reaches the small bowel, using Proteases created by Lactobacilli to become active.  The inability to metabolize it makes it worse, because it will continue to act on GI flora, allowing resistant pathogens to flourish.  If they just sprayed it on the plants, the bT would just die in the stomach.  But this is not the case when it is produced by a gene that is attached to undigestable fibers that clear every portion of the GI tract.What you and other proponents of Bt refuse to understand is that the gene that produces this toxin is protected by an undigestable insoluble polysaccharide, which allows it to clear the stomach acids and reach the small bowel.  In the small bowel there are Lactobacilli such as L. Rhamnosis that produce over 40 protein-enzymes, which are required for the Bt toxin to activate.  NONE of these “studies” have ever been done in a human host with a human microbiota.  The lab tests are skewed because they do not include the human microbiota and the organisms that are directly affected by the chemical produced from these genes.  This is critical, because it is the chemical produced by other organisms that activate the Bt toxin.  The affect on and how it interacts with Lactobacilli and Bifido bacteria have never been studied, or, at worst, never released to the public.  Based on what I know, Bt toxin in theory should have an adverse affect on gut flora.  I also think it would have an interaction with proteases that would prevent the proper digestion of certain proteins, namely, complex plant proteins such as wheat gluten and cassein.  Until there are detailed, in depth studies done on how Bt interacts with a real, live human gut microbiota over a large participant base, I will reserve my endorsement on the “safety” of such a chemical…Thank you for clearing that up….Bio film is allowing B.t  to make it past the stomach ….ok I can see that being  possible…
We should talk some time .Business is growing perhaps you can help make the EARTH GREAT AGAIN …Humor…send me your number….or I can send you mine.Pingback: ()When I’m producing a product with tomatoes in it. Heating proces 17 minutes 95 degrees for destroying BT. Is this to long. Can anyone help me with this? For the product it’s to long because its damage the product structure.. In earlier stadium someone told us 17 minute for 95 degrees. Thanks for your help.Ms. Ellis, my leaky gut is not imaginary.Many days I can not leave the house.I am unable to work due to this disease.Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome took many, many years to be recognized as legitimate health problems.Why did my “leaky gut” begin in 2003, coinciding with the secretive unleashing of b t corn in America? For years I have been gluten free, by necessity, not choice.The more organic foods I eat, the less I am stuck in my bathroom.
