Place it in the microwave for about 10 seconds.  Press it onto the bite three times for the count of one one thousand, two one thousand three one thousand.  The wet paper towel can get hot depending on your microwave, so be careful.The remedies are great, but how about some natural sure fire mosquito repellants?  I don‚Äôt know about you, but I would rather NOT get the bites in the first place.

I usually wash at night in the summer with a tea tree oil based natural soap. Bar or liquid, doesn‚Äôt matter. The tea tree oil stops the itching for me, and if you have any cuts or scrapes from the day it also keeps those disinfected. For fast relief I either do garlic or a baking soda paste.

Inflammation also gone! That was supposed to say, ‚Äùwhite vinegar‚Äù and garlic powder pasteChapstick!!!!  The medicated works best  but really any will work. It will also work on cuts and burns (curling irons etc).  I always carry a tube. You gotta try it.  Easier and something that really works every time. I tried both the vinegar and baking soda and NEITHER worked. I still have a lot of inflammation, redness and itchiness. It‚Äôs been almost 24 hours and I haven‚Äôt scratched them once. When I get mosquito bites they are disgusting, large, swelling bumps unless I treat them right away. Toothpaste has always been a big one for me. I apply it on and around the bit to reduce the swelling and halt the itching. I also try to apply some as soon as I am bitten, to keep it from swelling at all. It‚Äôs super effective and relieving. My family never believed that it worked but this has proven my theory.BANANA PEELS is also a big one to reduce itching. Rub the inside of the peel on the wound to keep from scratching.I‚Äôve put chapstick on burns and bites.

BEWARE-it stainsWhat exactly is neem?hi i have really bad reddened misquito bites and i have like milky pale freckled skin, but im a basic sugar candy walking around for these misquitos (srry lil humor there but its true ^-^;) since im also O negative blood type. i have milk and honey chapstick and was wondering if that could heal and get rid of the misquito bites. im very self conscious about them right now and all i have on me to use is witch hazel, generic benadryl cream, hydrocortizone cream, bottled aloe vera gel (dont know about the 100 proof though its just plain aloe vera gel i also have one that is blue colored and has lidocaine in it the other one is green just being plain aloe vera gel i guess), vicks vapor rub, kosher salt, and honey. if someone can tell me how many time to put either of these items on my bites so they can go away i would appreciate that very much. thank you. i also have that nivea milk and honey chapstick, would that work to heal and clear up the bites and the scars as well?What I always do is put hot water on my bite till it tingles.

Then what should I do (for my daughter)?Have you tried the remedies above?I have many mosquito bites all over me but none are itching.

Should I use some of the remedies on these itches?No sign of a bite or any irritation at all but your skin is just itchy?I‚Äôm in Arizona and am like you. They LOVE me and my bites swell to 1/2‚Ä≥ diameter or larger. I cover myself if I go out to sit around at night with Avon Skin So Soft. It works. Last night I didn‚Äôt and got 3 bites. I had read about either heat or ice, so tried both. Dip a spoon in hot, almost boiling water and tap it on the bite until you can hold it there. I followed it with ice, applied directly. Wow, NO swelling ! and the itch was gone shortly after. Just be careful not to burn yourself. I was amazed.Believe it or not, natural remedies also contain chemicals. In fact, just about anything that is matter is made of chemicals to some degree. I wish you just learned some science and understood why those natural remedies work. Toxins from the mosquitos saliva are usually proteins, which can be denatured with heat, pH changes, or salination changes. This is why most of the remedies work. Vinegar or Lemon juice are relatively acidic and hence denatures the toxin proteins. Baking Soda is basic and also deantures toxin proteins.Most of the treatments that you can pick up non-prescription are made using the same principles, although due to dilution, method variations etc. their effectiveness varies as well. The most useful mosquito bite treatment I‚Äôve used was a lotion in china, which was essentially a form of acid mixed in with salinated water. You could use a combination of lime juice and salt and it would work the same way, but usually the ‚Äúchemical‚Äù remedies have gone through clinical testing to make sure that the treatment won‚Äôt hurt you, compared to random ideas posted by random strangers, such as piercing a starburst/cross across the swelling (that‚Äôs just begging for infection). TL;DR Learn some science and you would understand that rather than going OMG chemicals, you should actually read the labels and understand (roughly) what the chemicals mean and do to you.Aloe vera gel stops the itch of mosquito bites, but it has the added benefits of moisturizing the skin & repelling mosquitos. Rub it generously all over your arms, neck, face, legs and you won‚Äôt get any more bites. It soaks right in and makes your skin feel great. Sure worked on my kids when they were little.Great tip, thanks!Pingback: ()That‚Äôs very lame and not true. I wonder what moron gave you a up vote- probably yourself. Same goes for your sockpuppet michelle telfoNo- what you‚Äôre looking for is treatment for crabs or bedbugs.BANANA PEEL! Rub a piece of banana peel over the bite for 1-2 minutes. Gets ride of itching and swelling in less than 5 minutes. Hope this helped! These are great! The only thing that caught my eye as off was the essential oil, as it is oil it can‚Äôt be diluted in water. Myself, I‚Äôd recommend blending it with another antbactiral oil, like coconut!Thank you so much. I will use these natural remedies next time a nasty mosquito bite me. Can I use these for other insect bites too. Do Fruit Flies bite human beings? I just use a bit of water to wet the area, and put on some salt. When it dries, the bite doesn‚Äôt itch anymore. There‚Äôs a lot of mosquitos here in Taiwan, especially in summer.I have an infected mosquito bite on my leg, and it is filled with pus.

What do I do?Pingback: ()Hi I have inherited my mother‚Äôs capability of growing tolerant to medicinal stuff, and mosquitoes love me here in CO, so I‚Äôve tried: Salt paste, Honey, Aloe, Hydrocortizone creams, Benadryl Creams and gels, Solarcaine.

There is nothing in them that wasn‚Äôt culled from Nature in one way or another. Even plastic‚Äôs components come from Nature‚Ä¶ Nature (God, if you prefer) made everything. All the raw materials. But Man (read: scientists) alters these raw materials by the natural components and reacting them in various ways in such a manner that the combined end product rarely has any resemblance to anything remotely ‚Äúnatural‚Äù by the time the whole sequencing of combinations and interactions is all said and done. Being a science student, I‚Äôm sure you are aware of all this. Which means that you are being less than ingenuous with your remonstration and annoyance.Another piece of the puzzle you may or may not choose to be aware of is that those impressive-sounding ‚Äúclinical testings‚Äù you so fondly bring up are, in fact, funded by massive drug/chemical companies who want to see certain results, supporting the drugs they want to launch. How much work do you think would be garnered by a clinical trials company that consistently gives these massive drug companies unfavorable results in testing their drugs? Of course, they put on a good show and do years of ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù and ‚Äútesting‚Äù and ‚Äúclinical trials‚Äù. But, in the end, just how reliable can those tests be, given the whole picture?These same drug/chemical companies also fund the schools and universities that you ‚ÄúScience students‚Äù and medical students, pharmacists and other ‚Äòhealthcare professionals‚Äù go to. In effect, they get to dictate the curriculum and what gets introduced into your belief systems. And they do. Further, they have multi-million (more likely multi-billion) dollar advertising accounts with all types of media. Which means that they can tell them how to spin their products in their ‚Äúnews‚Äù stories. And they do. They also fund politicians‚Äô campaigns heavily and so carry a lot of clout in government. You could say they have the government in their back pockets and can dictate policy. And they do. Just take a closer look at how many former Monsanto and Bayer, Dow, Dupont executives are now sitting and/or have sat in top seats in government. Do you think they are there because they decided to reform and work for humanity?So please spare us the references to the all-mighty ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù and ‚Äúclinical trials‚Äù. Those seriously compromised segments of society are mostly just plain scary.Having said all that, I do wish you well in your studies. Perhaps you will be a morally upright scientist in the end. But then, you will also probably be unemployed.A few drops of lavender oil, a few drops of peppermint oil, incorporated into some coconut oil. Works perfectly!Pingback: ()Hey I just used the lemon juice remedy on my bite and it the bulb went down and the itchiness settled:)Another thing is if you/your wife are breastfeeding, breastmilk! It helps with itchiness & reduces the swelling.Pingback: ()Chickpea flour is one of the best ways to treat ant bites. It is enriched with essential minerals like phosphorus, manganese, and iron.essential oil works best for me, tried vinegar, backing soda, but no usePingback: ()Pingback: ()They‚Äôre not supposed to get rid of them, just stop the itching.

Hopefully someof these will help me My mom always put rubbing alcohol in her hand and gently scratched it onto my mosquito bites when I was a kid. I believe you should do this as quickly as possible after getting bit. If you wait to long it may not work. I have used this same method on myself and my kid‚Äôs. Within a short time, the itching stops and you will not have the bump at all by the next morning. It works very well.Rubbing alcohol works amazing. Gently rub it onto the bite as soon as possible. The itching stops within a few minutes and will eliminate the bumps as well. My mom used this on my as a child & I have always used this method on my children. It works very well.Pingback: ()Peanut butter and a little jelly. It doesn‚Äôt work, but tastes good when you lick it off.Here‚Äôs what helps me‚Ä¶ rubbing ICE on the bite until it feels cold and numb! pat dry it and put Cortizone on. i find this gives me relief for a little bit longer.I swear by rubbing ice on it for a couple seconds, the itching can go away just by doing that. Then I‚Äôll smother it in toothpaste and just keep it on for the rest of the day. I‚Äôm not sure how to completely get rid of one though.I would use Ice Packs so then it would smoothe the mosquito bump and wait 30-45 mins then get Toothpaste and rub a bit on it. Next day‚Ä¶ POOF it‚Äôs gone. I recommend this to you if it doesn‚Äôt take away the bump in a day it would take at least 2 to 3 days so this is a good strategy but you would need to leave out the area of the bump when taking shower and when you go to sleep you would have to leave the leg with the bump out to let it get air while you sleep.i used peroxide and it worked right away try that and also witch hazel someone told me afterbite get at walmart, but so far so good with the peroxide I guess it gets the saliva out from the mosquitoes which cause the itch hope this help you I have over 20 bites and was miserable so I tried the peroxide and thank God it does work clean with soap and water get a cotton ball and put peroixe heavily on it.me too in Florida i used peroxide and it worked right away try that and also witch hazel
