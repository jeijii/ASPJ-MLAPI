      In today’s society, rarely is the news positive. Whether it’s on a local, national, or global level, networks generally focus on stories that can leave us disheartened and upset. Even some natural health websites will shift their focus of educating their audience on the benefits of  toward capitalizing on fear about food in our country, warning people the dangers and seemingly disastrous state of dietary trends in America. Fortunately, there have been great strides in nutrition for many people all across the world, and the demand for healthy foods is creating wider availability.         There is wonderful news coming from schools, farming, and market trends, and things are looking up for the  community. Here are some encouraging facts about our food system to hopefully help brighten your outlook.    Your parents, athletic coaches, and doctors probably consistently tell you to “eat healthier,” but newer generations seem to have taken this advice to heart with little coaxing. The latest market statistics indicate that generation Z and Millennials both will pay more of a premium for healthier foods than the Baby Boomer generation.     It’s even been shown that farmers whose animals are pasture fed and non-GMO can actually make a better living by keeping their meat organic.  Claims have even been made that  can “feed the world”  if implemented in the appropriate ways. The biggest benefit of organic farming, though, would most likely be the fact that organically grown crops have proven more drought resistant.    The nutritional value of traditional school lunches across the U.S. has been the subject of many heated debates. Perhaps you’ve seen the now popular images of school lunches around the world.  Now, some major U.S. school districts have taken the first step in providing healthier, more balanced lunches for our nation’s students, even opting to serve antibiotic-free chicken.  Perdue Farms has committed to taking its hatching chicks off , and Chick-Fil-A has a five year plan to be antibiotic free. I personally find the best benefit in a raw, vegan diet and won’t be eating any of those foods. All in all, it’s still one step in a positive direction.    Even Hershey’s, the notable chocolate company, has elected to ban  in their products!  With more and more notable members in this nation electing to offer healthier options for the food we put in our bodies, it’s hopeful that the number of people opting for healthier living will continue to grow.
