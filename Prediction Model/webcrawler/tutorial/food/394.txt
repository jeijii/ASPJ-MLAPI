    Multiple studies have determined that consumption of hot dogs can be a risk factor for childhood cancer.Peters et al studied the relationship between the intake of certain foods and the risk of leukemia in children from birth to age 10 in Los Angeles County between 1980 and 1987. The study found that children who ate more than twelve hot dogs per month had nine times the normal risk of developing childhood leukemia.         Researchers Sarusua and Savitz studied childhood cancer in Denver and found that children born to mothers who consumed hot dogs one or more times per week during pregnancy had about double the risk of developing brain tumors. Children who ate hot dogs one or more times per week were also at higher risk of brain cancer. Bunin et al also found that children of mothers who consumed hot dogs during pregnancy had an increased risk of childhood brain tumors. Most hot dogs contain preservatives called nitrites. During the cooking process, nitrites combine with amines naturally present in meat to form carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds. It is also suspected that nitrites combine with amines in the human stomach to form N-nitroso compounds. These compounds are carcinogens and have been associated with cancer of the oral cavity, bladder, esophagus, stomach, and brain. It is true that nitrites are commonly found in many green vegetables, especially spinach, celery, and green lettuce. However, the consumption of . How is this possible? The explanation lies in the formation of N-nitroso compounds from nitrites and amines. Nitrite containing vegetables also have vitamins C and D, which help inhibit the formation of N-nitroso compounds., including bacon. Sorry, bacon lovers.    Not all hot dogs contain nitrites. Nitrite-free hot dogs, while they taste the same as nitrite hot dogs, have a brownish color that has limited their popularity among consumers. Although I don’t recommend processed meat of any sort, between the two, nitrite-free hot dogs are better than their counterpart.        Do not buy hot dogs that contain nitrites. Additionally, if your children eat lunch at school, contact the school and find out if they’re being served nitrite hot dogs in the cafeteria, request that they use only nitrite-free hot dogs. Or, better yet, discourage the use of processed meat entirely.    Do hot dogs have a place in your home? Are you concerned? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts with us.

Having had my mother in four different facilities, a familiar theme was the CHEAP PROCESSED FOOD.  The main meal of the day is packed with gobs of unnecessary carbohydrates, heavy sauces that mask a myriad of dietary no-no’s and why not top it all off with a sugary beverage and dessert?  With little to no fresh fruit or vegetables, the food contents of the primary daily meal can’t possibly cost more than $2.00/plate.  Dinner, a lighter late afternoon meal, offers choices of lunchmeat sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly, hotdogs, and other processed garbage.  One Christmas, a facility served the residents filet mignon and fresh vegetables proving that they DO know the difference between a healthy meal versus cheap ingredients that they call “food.”  Remember when school cafeteria called ketchup a vegetable?  With senior skilled nursing facilities charging THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS a month for room and board, everyone knows this food is a lousy excuse for a meal but until children of these residents (and what about their doctors!?!?) speak out and insist on something better, your loved ones are eating meals that I wouldn’t serve my four-legged companion animals.So how do you find out which vegetable brands don’t have nitrite?I did a search for “nitrite free hot dogs” and found a whole bunch.Thanks man. did you get any results on vegetables?I buy the “nitrate” free meat, especially bacon. The packages have mice type writing saying – except nitrates naturally occurring in celery juice powder. So are these meats with the celery juice powder ok or are they just as bad as the regular nitrates?There are some deli/lunch meats nitrate free like Hormel, Applegate, etc.  Yet why aren’t older people dropping off from all the nitrate foods  eaten for decades? They are living longer.  I do not eat processed meats.
