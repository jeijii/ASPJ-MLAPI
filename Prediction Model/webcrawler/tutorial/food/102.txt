Salt is a wonderful thing. Whether from the far reaches of the Himalayan rock mountains, to the depths of the ocean floor, salt is a beautiful and necessary mineral. It’s an important element in keeping the proper mineral balance in practically all of the earth’s living creatures.In fact, every cell in our body needs salt. Our bodies rely on salt to keep good bone density, proper circulation and stabilized blood sugar levels. But how could something so wonderful and natural become a poison? Here are a few common misconceptions and dangers of salt.“” is a manufactured form of sodium called sodium chloride. While similar to naturally occurring rock, crystal, or sea salt, table salt merely mimics the taste of these elements.Table salt is created by taking natural salt (or crude oil flake leftovers) and cooking it at 1200° Fahrenheit. Once the unprocessed salt is heated up to this temperature, it starts to lose the majority of the eighty important elements that are naturally occurring. Other naturally occurring forms of sodium, including sea salts and , are harvested and dried in the sun.They are actually alkaline minerals that help keep us hydrated, balance our sodium-potassium ratios, as well as fill the body with powerful electrolytes. They also contain all of the trace elements needed for proper immune, thyroid and adrenal function (that are completely stripped out of table salt). Real forms of salt also boost the creation of digestive enzymes and juices that allow us to extract and assimilate other vitamins and nutrients from the food we eat.Commonly purchased iodized salts, available at super markets or sitting on the table of your favorite restaurant, have synthetic chemicals added to them. These chemicals include everything from manufactured forms of sodium solo-co-aluminate, iodide, sodium bicarbonate, fluoride, anti-caking agents, toxic amounts of potassium iodide and aluminium derivatives. It may come as a shock, but most table salt is not only unhealthy, but can sometimes be toxic.The natural forms of important  is lost when we manufacture salt. Without this , the thyroid is severely harmed, leading to growth and metabolism issues. Because of this, the chemical-based salt industry began to add synthetic forms of iodine to their products.Other salts add things such as processed white sugar and toxic MSG (mono-sodium-glutamate). And what about the color of table salt? Salt found in the natural world is not usually white. Table salt has been colored white with bleach. And where does this salt come from? Much of it is the actual flaky residue from oil digging. That is correct. Crude oil extract is one way we produce table salt.Table salt causes the blood pressure to rise rapidly because the blood is attempting to move the toxic elements rapidly away from the heart. This is why doctors will often tell people with high blood pressure to stop intake of salt. Moreover, excessive table salt causes us to retain waters and other fluids. Many chronic imbalances such as diabetes, gout and obesity can be worsened or even partially caused by excessive intake of common table salt. And be aware, this salt is not just the stuff in your shaker.Most packaged and processed foods contain astronomical amounts of the stuff. These preservatives can cause swelling and, over time, major kidney, thyroid and liver problems, as well as the development of goiters, asedema, hypertension, heart disease, strained elimination systems, muscle cramps, water retention, edema, stroke, heart failure, , and even major nervous system disorders such as anxiety and depression.Table salt is particularly hard on both the circulatory system and nervous system. It also wreaks havoc on the delicate balance of the lymph system in the body. This salt is also highly addictive, as the more the body becomes used to the high levels of fake sodium, the more it craves it.Remember, everything in moderation. Salt has many , but you when used excessively, it can also have many dangers. I personally stopped using traditional table salt, and switched to himalayan salt years back. It’s all my family uses.

Much tastier than salt and better for you!As mentioned in the article, when I do use salt, I also opt for Himalayan saltI’m switching our family over to Himalayan Pink Salt.  I’m also making some bath salts for family and friends in the Gulf Coast area using Himalayan Pink salt but since it is SOOOOO expensive and not readily available in our area I was thinking of cutting it with another less expensive natural form of salt.  I wonder if you have any good ideas on which type salt to use?  At first I was thinking about epsom salt but I know it must be bleached and was wondering if they make epsom in a natural form?Any ideas?
Thanks HeatherHi Heather! I’d recommend using sea salt or celtic sea salt. Hope this helps. ~Dr. GWe have all been informed that table salt is dangerous and can cause high blood pressure. Can you also get high blood pressure from Himalayan Salt? Is there a limit of use that needs to be addressed?Thank you!I would like to add that we prefer, in order:
– Himalayan Salts;
– Sea Salt (flakes);
– Sea Salts (other).This is complete garbage. Sodium chloride is sodium chloride. It doesn’t matter where you get if from. It’s whatever is added to it that may or may not have adverse effects. Sodium chloride is safe to consume. And the term “organic” does not mean what you think, it’s impossible for sodium chloride to be organic because it doesn’t contain carbon. Also, a salt is just a metallic element bonded with a nonmetallic element. Silver nitrate is a salt used as an antimicrobial in the medical field, while silver fulminate is a salt that is highly explosive. Please do your homework before wasting your money because some quack on the internet told you to.You’re right, much better to get your health information from anonymous guys named John.In other words, mr angry, when you are sold dodgy sodium chloride from a disreputable source (polluted) it is still sodium chloride! Wow, what a revelation you are.
A s for saying sodium chloride is safe to consume. You need to get some education here. Sodium chloride for people with hypertension or in danger of it, is best avoided, as all the “SALTS” we need come from plant based material. We can ley the ionic bonds do the rest.So where in the article was it claimed that sodium chloride is organic?
Please do your homework before wasting your breath telling us some quack rubbish.Just want “John” to know that ever since I stopped using table salt, and started using Himalayan Pink Salt……I’ve been anxiety free. None. Nada. Zilch.
Fuck table salt. Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.There is so much ignorant nonsense in this article. Sodium chloride ie salt is not essential for life. Salts are essential for life, not salt. The industry has made trillions from people unable to understand English grammar. Salts yes. Salt no.  Sodium chloride may be safe to consume in small quantities, very small if daily. It is a petro chemical derivative, unless it’s sea salt or rock salt. It has toxic pollutants laced in it and is responsible for multiple illnesses.
Sodium and chloride are obtainable from plants, all the sodium requirements are there, added sodium chloride is not necessary for any cellular health at all.Pingback: ()John, i guess you work for the pharmaceutical industry ! Anything that man gets his greedy hands on to make money from the sick and the poor is going to harm you! All my clients that go on to natural sea salt and avoids table salt have improved their health beyond belief. If we drink plenty of fresh clean pure water with our diet, that combined with pure sea salt, your life will improve and your energy will increase .Blood pressure is actually more regulated with natural salt (himilayan, sea, etc) that has not been tampered with by pharmaceutical.  They contain nessecary trace elements,  the same that were originally removed by pharmaceutical in vitamins. They were called inert, actually they are the activators needed by the body to utilize vitamins.  Well said. It is true about the difference.All these people are retarded. This guy is right.Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()HAHA “naturally occurring salt is not white”…you idiot only adulterated/contanminated salt isn’t white.  Take a chemistry class you quack and check out the Salar de Uyuni, natural salt deposits in the grand Canyon, and sea salt harvesting if you think salt isn’t white.Sodium Chloride is NOT a petro chemical derivitive.  It naturally occurs in “table” and “sea” salt (all come from evaporation of salt water).  In fact it makes up about 85% of “table” and “sea” salt.  You are very ignorant.  “Sea” salt can have lots of pollutants (from sea life, waste, chemicals that get dumped in the ocean, etc.. )  I’d rather have the “Table” salt which is usually from deep mines that came from ancient less polluted sea beds. P.S. I am in no way related to the salt industry.  So much nonsense about sea salt.Pingback: ()Pingback: ()If table salt is concidered so toxic, Why the FDA didn’t banned it in the first place. How do we actually know there is enough iodine inside Himalayan Rock Salt for our daily requirement.Hello John, please keep ingesting lots of sodium chloride so you will die quicker and we won’t have to listen to your lies anymore. Sodium Chloride RUSTS IRON, you idiot and your blood has IRON IN IT, if you didn’t know that and rusted iron is KNOWN as OXIDATION and it’s that oxidation that’s KILLING morons like eWe, and Sodium Chloride causes your body more health issues than any germ or virus ever has.  😉Amen!  😀Try Potassium Nitrate instead.  😉Have your “clients” use Potassium Nitrate instead.  😉The improperly educated masses makes it easier for TPTB to pilfer the sheeple’s pockets. That’s how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  😉“You should treat your personal statements like they are
a Contract with God, because you are making a contract with God anytime you think to yourself and/or open your mouth publicly, so always be meticulous with your choice of werds and how you say them.” – Old Toad ProverbIf Sodium Chloride was banned from human food and animal feed, the doctors would become the Maytag Repairmen of the Human Body and go out of business.  😉Potassium Nitrate is the best “salt” to ingest.  😉Potassium Nitrate is the BEST choice and any doctor that recommends ANY version of Sodium Chloride, should have their license revoked.  😉Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Yeah, ’cause there’s no other diseases and stuff in the world left to cure for doctors just because Sodium Chloride would be banned…Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()There is so much wrong in this article that one cannot think of where to start to correct other than to write the whole article from scratch and not making the same false accusations ever again 😀Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()
