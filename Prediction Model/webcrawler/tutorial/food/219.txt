I’ve used it on my lips and dry skin occasionally for a few years now. It really helps the patches of really dry skin I have and heals my lips when they are really bad. This last month and a half I started using it on a fresh surgery scar (had ulnar nerve surgery), I wipe on witch hazel, let it dry and then rub on the body balm to keep it soft as it stiffens up if I don’t keep it moisturized. I have noticed that it is starting to fade more than my scars usually do. My last big scar took several years to stop being red and fade. I am finding less redness each day and even white skin begining to come through in spots and the tough lumpy tissue under the scar is begining to dissipate. Not sure its because of the hemp oil but I’m very happy since I scar easily and they usually don’t actually disappear.Hi, which brand yo use and how much per day and when you take your doses in relation to meals?
