        You want to lose weight, so you start trying to . The most obvious starting place seems to be switching from  to foods with zero calorie sweeteners, like . Better known by brand names, such as Equal, NutraSweet, and Spoonful, aspartame seems like a no-brainer. Fewer calories equals weight loss, right?            In fact, study after study has shown just the opposite.  and all other artificial sweeteners lead to weight gain, not weight loss. So, not only may aspartame be the most toxic additive to foods, instead of helping you lose weight, it actually makes it even tougher to lose it!    Dr. Qing Yang, of the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University, explains.  He suggests that multiple factors are at play:    Studies have shown that not only does aspartame cause weight gain, it causes greater weight gain than a diet with with the same calorie intake, but no aspartame.  So it’s becoming more and more clear that there’s a lot more to weight reduction than counting calories.    Aspartame contains the chemicals phenylalanine and aspartate. Both of these substances increase fat storage. They interfere with insulin and leptin, which control how fat is handled, whether it’s stored, how it’s stored, where it’s stored, and how it’s used.    Fat metabolism is deranged by aspartame, with the inevitable result of causing people to pack on the pounds when they’re trying to do exactly the opposite.    The fact is that aspartame is not the shortcut to weight loss that marketers want you to believe. The only true thing about the advertising is that it doesn’t have any calories. But, as you’ve seen here, weight loss is about more than calories.    In short, aspartame makes you fat by:    Of course, I don’t advise eating sugar. It causes more than enough problems. However, if you cannot control your sweet tooth, sugar is less harmful than aspartame—or any other artificial sweetener — and probably won’t cause as much weight gain. Isn’t it amazing that a product sold to help you lose weight actually has the opposite effect? Worse than that, it actually makes you crave more of it, so you’ll end up getting even fatter.    What a fat pack of lies!

I am pissed that aspartame contains 4 calories per packet!!! Not good since it says 0 but you know what? A lot of stuff that says 0 is allowed to legally because 4 is so much. I am going to start counting it but overall I am not diabetic but love thr stuff and yes it is enjoyable!!! It is better than the regular sugar and works I only had to use 3 packets today and I am going to bed after eating less than required sugar aside. Oh well you live and you learn. I will make a note of it everytime I use it. Misleading but still permissable. I rather have it than diabetes and fda approved.After doing research on the actual facts.  This is all a lie.  Not only from research but I have put this into practice.  I have lost over 30 pounds switching from soda to aspartame drink packets.Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()I was prescribed fibre gel to increase fibre intake due to recently diagnosed diverticulosis as despite my already healthy diet of fibre it wasn’t having the desired effect. But……it contains Aspartame. Over a 12 month while i was prescribed fibre gel in that same period i gain 14 pounds of which i was baffled as my diet was always healthy.  I also had an increase in cravings for sweet stuff despite my diet remaining the same as before. As soon as i did some research  i found the link i stopped taking fibre gel and resorted to a natural pysillium husk product with nothing added.  And slowly i started to get my weight down again and the sugar cravings dissapeared. I can categorically say yes there is a 100% link from my own experience. During this time my diet never altered. Before or after.Now I’m confused. Were you able to keep the weight off?  I’ve gone back and forth on this substance.I’m only reading about this because the nicotine gum I like contains it.  I have mixed feelings about aspartame. Doesn’t help that it’s illegal  or not allowed in some countries.
