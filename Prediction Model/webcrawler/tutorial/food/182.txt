Zinc is necessary for many of the bodyâ€™s processes and most people are chronically deficient in this vital mineral. It is an active agent in our bodyâ€™s ability to metabolize food and nutrients. It is also involved with triggering over 100 differing internal enzymes required for many metabolic actions. Zinc is also crucial for the health of the human immune system. It aids growth through its role in protein building and synthesis, and is therefore particularly needed in pregnant and lactating women.It also plays a role in the bodyâ€™s ability to heal itself after an injury. Zinc supports your sense of smell and is commonly linked to healthy eyes, skin and hair.

All of these seeds need to be soaked or fermented to be of any use, otherwise they are useless (and damaging) sources of zinc.Of course you left out oysters.Must be a vegan site. Zinc from plant sources are difficult to assimilate. Sorry, but tis true. Specifically, it is very easy to get too much micronutrient copper.  Mineral zinc, however, is in vast amounts is necessary to balance copper, and can only be obtained in large amounts  from animal foods, in particular eggs and red meats. It is wrong to mislead people.Regarding the bioavailability of zinc, on the NIH website, vegans/vegetarians simply need to eat more foods with zinc for optimal health.  Eating bread (a leavened product) and soaking your own beans before cooking, as well as eating sprouted beans â€“ sprouted lentils are widely available at health-conscious grocers, can eliminate the concern of the people who for some reason canâ€™t stand the vegan/vegetarian mentality.  Moreover, many people who eat meat are still deficient in zinc, this in a country gorging itself on animal protein.  Considering the high cholesterol, fat, gmo-fed, antibiotic use with growth hormone shots along with other drugs administered in the highly profitable agro-meat industry, the less animal products consumed today, the better.  And we havenâ€™t even touched on the dangerous by-products of our high meat-consuming culture on the environment â€“ worse than the pollution from our cars.  If our seas and soil are contaminated with chemical pollutants, then so too are the animals who are facing the worst of these conditions- meaning humans are getting not one, but two doses of these chemicals when we consume them.Carol I have psorsis on my leg n in my hair its also flares up in other places.
