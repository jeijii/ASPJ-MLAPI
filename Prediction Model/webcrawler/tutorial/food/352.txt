      Meat in its natural state is not totally harmful. The thing is, we don’t often get it in its natural state, and common preparation methods for . Consider the changes that cows go through before they come to us. Questionable medications, antibiotics, pesticide laden and GMO feed…all of this can be passed on to humans.        There’s a heated debate regarding the health benefits–or lack thereof–of eating meat. On one end, grass-fed beef may contain higher amounts of , protein, and vitamin B12; however,  and heart disease.   These effects are seen in greater amounts when connected to processed meats treated with nitrates as well as those meats that have been cooked at high temperatures.   Here’s some of the issues with conventional meat:    Hormones such as  (rBGH) and recombinant bovine somatropin (rBST) are commonly given to cattle and poultry to increase meat content.  Steroids and antibiotics are also given to keep cows relatively free from disease, especially if they’re in confined conditions. There is also some debate that hormones in conventional livestock could be contributing to irregular growth patterns in children and even adults.     Infections are rampant because cows are kept in such close proximity to one another. So, along with the hormones, cows are fed large amounts of antibiotics to fight off inevitable infections. The trouble is, these  could be contributing to the antibiotic resistance crisis that is hitting the developing world.  To compound the problems with raising cows, the calves are fed the blood and other slaughterhouse wastes from slaughtered cows to provide them with protein. Really, whatever health concerns the cow may have had (worms, cancerous tumors) is recycled back into the next generation of cattle, pigs, and chickens.    If all that isn’t bad enough, there is food stuffs called “rendered” food, which is what people feed to their pets. It’s also stuff that’s fed to livestock, which means it winds up in your supermarket, then on your plate, and ultimately inside your body. Rendered food is produced from the cooking of dead and sometimes rotting animal carcasses.  The animals include cattle, pigs, chickens, and whatever else that inadvertently gets caught in the mix. And it includes whatever is in and on the animals already, like antibiotics, euthanasia chemicals, pesticides, and so much more.    The best strategy to protect your health is to reduce or eliminate meat from your diet. If you must eat meat, choose varieties that are grass fed or free range, and purchase from local farmers you can trust. The argument for wild game makes a lot of sense but, because of , even that has its risks.     Have you given up meat? How do you feel? Please let us know your experience in the comments!

Meat is only toxic to the colon when its cooked. If you eat raw meat, its not toxic at all! The problem here is obvious: most people cook meat! You really need to get yourself educated and update this article. This is the load of crap that is feeding the minds of people in this word and why people become sick, fat and have to rely on the healthcare system. Educate yourselves! To back up my point with the facts, raw meat has glutathione, as does raw dairy. Look it up! This is what cooked meat does not have, or pasteurized dairy. Its destoryed, which the body can’t use the destroyed proteins and then accumulates in the colon.wrong!I’ve given up meat and I live it. I will never go back. I’m much healthier. One day I’d like to be about 80 % raw. Of course dead flesh is bad for you but it’s obvious to many people are addicted to it. At least research about the vegan diet, eat a vegan meal then add your meat to it. I’m sure that’s better than the  sad diet
