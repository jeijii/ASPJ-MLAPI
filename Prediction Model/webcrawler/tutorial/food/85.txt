The thyroid is essential to some of the body’s most critical processes, including the development of the nervous and skeletal systems. For the thyroid to function normally, it must receive the right nutrition, and that means getting enough selenium. Selenium is an essential mineral and being deficient can lead to serious health problems such as Keshan disease, myxoedematous cretinism, Graves’ disease, and even thyroid destruction.         Although the body requires selenium, it does not produce selenium and you must get it through your diet. For most people, this isn’t a problem since many common  are a good source of selenium.

Before I discuss why this is so important to thyroid health, let’s first understand exactly what the thyroid does.    Your  is part of your endocrine system and one of the most crucial glands in your body.

Iodothyronine deiodinases exist in several forms and are not yet fully understood, but do seem to play a role in preventing hypothyroidism. These enzymes are essential for the activation of thyroid hormones. So, while iodine tends to get most of the credit for thyroid health, it cannot actually carry out its function without help from selenium.Your body does not produce its own selenium. All selenium must be obtained through food or supplements. Once ingested, the element is broken down into enzymes called . These enzymes exist in many forms, but two of the best understood are  (GP) and  (TR). The GP and TR enzymes promote antioxidant abilities on a cellular level. TR also aids in cell growth and helps process dehydroascorbic acid into vitamin C. None of these vital enzymes could exist without selenium.Selenium has also been shown to combat several thyroid-debilitating conditions  Common thyroid maladies can be caused by low selenium intake, including . With this condition, the thyroid first becomes inflamed and secretes excessive amounts of hormones. Then, over time, it starts producing far less than it needs.    Conditions like thyroiditis can lead to an imbalance of hormones and that can be the start of major disruptions in the body’s normal processes. , which is one such potential consequence, is a condition in which the thyroid fails to provide a sufficient level of thyroid hormones. The outcome can be serious and include abnormal heartbeat, low body temperature, and nervous system disorders. It can even disrupt the body’s ability to metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. What can contribute to hypothyroidism? You guessed it, selenium deficiency.  If thyroid health is important to you, you cannot overlook the importance of selenium.
