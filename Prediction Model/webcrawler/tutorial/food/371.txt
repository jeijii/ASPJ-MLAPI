    With its onion-custard flavor and an odor that resembles rotten gym socks, the durian fruit is perhaps the most notorious fruit of all. While supermarkets are slowly beginning to offer more internationally popular fruits, durian has yet to reach mainstream attention. The “why” isn’t much of a mystery.

I guess to each is own with flavor tastes.I tried some in Thailand. It was mild sweet tasting and very rich. I bought a couple for my gf in Davao once. It’s their favorite thing, along with balot. I am glad they ban this in hotel rooms. it smells like dead fish…Durian is like the king of fruits in Southeast Asia. Coming from Singapore, we have the best selections from the region. I only eat fresh open durian right at the store where u pick and the fruit seller open right in your eyes! Not frozen one anywhere or in USA. My usa husband HATE the smell;( . I love and miss durian! Weyo – Jackfruit is a totally different fruit / taste very different and it doesn’t smell. Looks similar.It tastes sweet and surprisingly delicate, very different than how it smells. It tastes amazingly good, in fact. Given the taste, I really can’t hate anything about durian. Even the smell. It does have a funk to it, but mostly it smells like durian, and that’s a GOOD thing.I’m USA born but traveled to Asia enough and have had enough Thai friends to come to love it. Please try Durian with sweet sticky rice and coconut sauce as my friend Amporn always made. Oh my God you will eat it till you are sick. See my documentary on Singapre on YouTube under the title Best Singapore Documentary. Best wishes to all Durian lovers
David Whitefield JonesJust tried the yellow durian. I think all the talk about the smell will scare people off. It’s taste was definitely better than the smell, but even that wasn’t so bad. Its sweet but not overly so, and it doesnt taste like the smell whatsoever. I’ll eat it again willingly lol, and I’ll enjoy it. I love it! There’s only one species that you can get in the US, because it’s the only one that can last long enough for export. It’s the largest of the fruit. But to get the best in taste you need to travel to the Southeast Asian countries. My personal favorite it from North Sulawesi, Indonesia, the taste very rich, and you may become intoxicated if you have enough.
For those who haven’t tried, get over the fear of the smell and all the horror stories you might have heard about durian. It’s absolutely delicious. Actually going out for some tonight, they happen to be in season.
