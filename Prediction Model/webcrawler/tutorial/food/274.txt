Cilantro is easy to grow, and it‚Äôs convenient to have fresh cilantro ready to use. Cilantro grows quickly and does not always transfer well, so plan on growing your cilantro from seed. Cilantro leaves stop growing and become bitter after the plant flowers. That is why it‚Äôs best to plant your cilantro in spring and fall, avoiding the longer, hotter summer days in-between.    Plant cilantro seeds in well-drained, well-fertilized soil. Choose a spot that gets full sun. Sow several seeds together one-quarter inch into the soil and six to eight inches apart. Water after planting and when the soil is dry to the touch.     Expect to wait three to four weeks before harvesting the cilantro leaves. Leaves can be harvested anytime during the growing process, but you should wait until the plant is at least six inches in height. If you want to harvest the leaves continually, sow new seeds every two to three weeks. Unlike other herbs, cilantro leaves lose most of their flavor when dried, so it‚Äôs better to use them fresh. If you need to preserve them, freezing is the best option.     The seeds of the cilantro plant‚Äîcoriander‚Äîrequire a different approach. The seeds can be used for planting or can be dried and used in a culinary capacity. Wait to harvest the seeds until most have turned brown on the plant. Cut off the stalk a few inches below the seeds. Tie the stalks in bunches and hang them upside down in a brown paper bag. After about five days, the dried seeds should fall from the stalks into the bottom of the bag. You can store the seeds in an airtight, glass container for up to a year. To release the flavors, dry-roast or grind before use.    Cilantro has been used in a variety of ways throughout recorded history.

ABI was just eating a dish with cilantro, which I was only introduced to this year. I thought I would look up the benefits of cilantro‚Ä¶thank you for such an informative site! I have really been enjoying learning about foods and my body and how they work together for good! FDA approved drugs are often dangerous for us. My dad always treated us with vitamins, herbs or something natural vs pharmaceutical..if possible! We are much healthier for that! I heard cilantro also helped to prevent cancer. Have you found any research on that?Where in your references is there proof that cilantro helps to remove metals?I should like to begin by having a small patch of home-grown Cilantro, which I was told would be good to treat memory associated problems. Is it true, that were I to ingest small portions of Cilantro ‚Äì I stand to benefit???‚ÄúWe also found Chinese parsley accelerates the excretion of Hg, Pb, and A1 from the body though the urine.‚ÄùIn Australia we call cilantro coriander, I think that you only refer to the fruit as coriander and the leaf as cilantro.  Cilantro or Coriander is great for reducing guilt.  Coriander is high in many vitamins and minerals, folic acid,
5-hydroxytryptophan, and is one of the highest natural sources of
S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Because coriander is generally not cooked for
long these chemicals are not denatured as they often are in other foods. By themselves each of these natural chemicals will significantly reduce guilt, when they are together in this plant they have a far greater effect!Do you make it as teaYou could but I think most people just eat it.Tried and true: store the cilantro stems and all in a salad spinner in the fridge. Toss it every few days. The air layer in the spinner keeps it dry and fresh, for up to three weeks.  I am actually growing cilantro. Just not sure when to pick it.

Yes this is true. But it does not pull them OUT of the body!
Using cilantro as a metal detoxer alone is very dangerous and I hope people do there own research before blindly trying to do it.
When cilantro pulls the metals out it redistributes them all over the body, often times leaving the person in worse shape than before.
Also, if you still have analgam dental fillings, you cannot metal detox until after you have them removed. Otherwise you are pulling metals from your mouth and putting them into your organs.
Look into ‚Äúbinders‚Äù. Like bentonite clay, Terramin clay, activated charcoal, etc.Pingback: ()I have been told that my daughter (15) was injected with metals through a vaccine that she received in school.

 GHC,Pingback: ()Pingback: ()whenever I am ill, or feeling run down, I CRAVE cilantro. My husband doesn‚Äôt like it, so I have to use it as a fresh addition to my own salad or cooked dish, but whenever I am stressed, cilantro seems to be a particular choice. I have read that many think it is akin to parsley, but it is not. I have grown it on my deck, and picked it fresh to add to my breakfast eggs. I love it, and know that I am healthy and balanced when I hav eaten enough cilantro that I no longer CRAVE it. Pay attention to your body; it will actually tell you what it needs. Good health to everyone.Cilantro cannot and will not hurt you. I found it easy to grow on my patio, in a pot, from seed. I would walk out and munch on it all summer long, before my morning coffee. It is great with eggs, too. Easy to grow from seed, and actually gratifying, if you have never grown much herbs, and I found it made me want to grow other herbs because I was so successful growing cilantro. If you like Mexican or Vietnamese or Chinese food, cilantro will be a good herb to grow, as it goes very well with all those culinary types, in my experience.Yes! Add it in the last few minutes of cooking, for best results. Even canned soup tastes better, when cilantro is added at the last minute before serving.Sounds delightful!Cilantro is good, and listen to your body: it will tell you what to eat or drink. Your kidneys need WATER, clean water, and any vegetables or fruits that are water-based, like cucumber, apple, tomato, or the like. Look at the food: does it contain or hold a lot of water? then it is probably good for your kidneys. Any cleanse you do must involve a lot of water. In a bath, in a soup, teas, whatever you take in though eating, drinking, or bathing: when you seek to cleanse, water and water containing dishes are good for you. Clean, fresh water can never hurt you, and will help all your major organs perform their functions better. Good health and good life to you; if you are asking these questions, you are already on the road to a healthy life!Would cilantro essential oil work just as well‚Ä¶.. and what should I put with it to help it get the mercury out of my body‚Ä¶. I can not afford to get the fillings out but would like to help my body rid the mercury on a daily basis‚Ä¶
