Vegetable glycerin, or glycerol, is a clear, odorless liquid produced from plant oils, typically palm oil, soy, or . Palm and coconut oils are natural triglyceride mixtures; each triglyceride is composed of three fatty acids esterified with glycerin. Vegetable glycerin has a number of valuable applications that include cosmetic products, foods, and as a replacement for alcohol in herbal and botanical tinctures.Vegetable glycerin is produced using an extraction process called hydrolysis. During hydrolysis, oils are placed under the combined force of pressure, temperature, and water. The ester bond breaks and causes the glycerin to split from fatty acids and be absorbed by water; at which point the resultant is further isolated by distillation to increase purity. Purified vegetable glycerin has a texture similar to an oil or syrup due to its organic molecular makeup, specifically, three hydroxyl groups.Vegetable glycerin used in food applications is USP grade or over 99% pure and has a sweet taste.

Cancer LOVES sugar.  When you vape vegetable glycerin you greatly help cancer thrive.  sugar levels spike in the body and if you have lung cancer‚Ä¶..  well what better way to feed the cancer in the lung than to give it sugar in an incredibly penetrating way through vapor.

It all didn‚Äôt happen for naught though, because now I can pass on new knowledge.  Perhaps now we can figure out how to put something devastating to cancer with the sugar vapor that will be greedily sucked up by the cancer therefore causing  it to happily kill itself.
