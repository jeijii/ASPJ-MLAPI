     Folate, or vitamin B9, is one of many essential vitamins. You may also be familiar with folic acid as a form of folate; folic acid is the synthetic version used for food fortification and supplements. Folate is important because it plays a role in DNA synthesis and repair.  It encourages cell and tissue growth.  In fact, these benefits barely scratch the surface and its effects are far reaching.  That bring us to nine incredible health benefits of folate.             and the benefits for pregnant women and their offspring cannot be understated. Folate deficiency during early pregnancy can lead to neural tube defects. This is a serious problem that can lead to pregnancy termination or a baby born with spina bifida.  The good news? Studies have found increased folate levels from one month prior to conception to 3 months afterward can reduce the chance of these defects by 50%.     Studies exploring the role of folate in spermatogenesis have linked it to sperm health and function.  Men with a lower folate intake have been shown to have sperm with incorrect chromosomal structure.  A 2012 study reported that previously infertile patients who took a nutritional supplement, which included folic acid, experienced significant improvement in sperm motility and successfully achieved pregnancy with their partners.     Folate helps metabolize homocysteine into methionine, an essential amino acid.  Without adequate folate, homocysteine levels increase.  You don’t want this; homocysteine has been linked to atherosclerosis and .  The evidence is clear, to  by facilitating the breaking down of homocysteine, folate is incredible.    Not only is homocysteine bad for the heart, it can lead to stroke.  An overabundance of homocysteine, or hyperhomocysteinemia, results from a breakdown in the methionine-homocysteine metabolism.  This results in increased chances of blood vessel damage and blood clotting. Although stroke can have many causes and no one measure is a complete safeguard, folate, or the supplemental form folic acid, have been recommended for use to reduce the risk.     A Polish study found folic acid supplementation encourages normal cholesterol levels.  In the study of 124 individuals, researchers observed significant reductions in LDL cholesterol levels in subjects who’d supplemented with .4 mg of folic acid daily for 12 weeks.  The result is believed to have been derived from reduced homocysteine levels.     Research suggests there may be a link between folate levels and neural health. A Korean study of elderly patients found that those suffering from dementia had the highest levels of homocysteine, and the lowest folate levels.  Patients in the control group who did not suffer from dementia had higher folate levels.     Often, perinatal depression cannot be addressed with pharmaceuticals due to concern for the child.  This has led researchers to seek out more safe, natural alternatives. Folate, along with other B vitamins, is known to encourage the creation and absorption of neurotransmitters.  Some experimental studies have indicated that micronutrients, including folic acid, can improve symptoms and outcomes.     Could folate be good for your colon? A 2013 case control study linked folate intake to gene activation that alters the chances of developing colorectal cancer.  It’s also a testament to the importance of diet at the cellular level.    A Harvard Medical School trial of women with a risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) explored the impact of B vitamin therapy (including folic acid, vitamin B6, and B12). The control group had a higher incidence of AMD than the group taking the B vitamin therapy. Researchers concluded that daily supplementation might help the fight in reducing the risk of AMD.     Within the body, . It has a positive action on cardiovascular, neural and psycho-emotional health. The research suggests that maintaining a consistent dietary intake of folate is essential to managing homocysteine metabolism and protecting long-term health. I agree.

Is it safe?” What do you think about Enlyte?Good question. We currently do not have information
about Enlyte, but we gathered a few details from the manufacturer’s site. According to them, Enlyte is free of artificial dyes, colors, and sweeteners-which is great. However, Enlyte contains a combination of folic acid and folate. Although it’s been working great for you, it may not be effective for individuals who have the MTHFR genetic mutation
since they cannot properly assimilate folic acid, which is the synthetic form of folate. Overall, we recommend eating foods with natural folate to meet your daily needs. Please reference: .Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()
