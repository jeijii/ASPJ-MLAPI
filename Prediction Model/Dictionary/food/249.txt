While the jury may be out on its aphrodisiac qualities, oysters have proven beneficial for testosterone levels.   A 3 ounce serving of oysters contains nearly 500% the recommended daily amount of zinc, an key element in testosterone production.  Oysters also contain D-aspartic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate, not so commonly occurring amino acids.  Studies have found fertile men possess high concentrations of D-aspartic acid.  When looking for a food to support testosterone, oysters seem like a great place to start!    Sure it’s great for the heart, tasty and a generally accepted component of a healthy diet.

Look specifically for almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, walnuts, pecans and peanuts.    This herb contains two substances, allicin and quercitin, which studies have found inhibit cortisol metabolism.  Cortisol is often called the stress hormone and in excess can slow or stop reproductive function.  Allicin and quercitin reduce the impact of cortisol, so the body can continue producing testosterone.     Omega-3 fatty acids and protein both support  testosterone levels, but that’s not how it made this list!  Salmon has the highest levels of vitamin D than any other fish.  And the male reproductive system requires vitamin D for health and proper function.

There is one item on the list I’d vote to remove and that item is olive oil. According to Drs. Wallach and Glidden, both men are NDs, “oil in a bottle” is one of ten “bad foods”. One part of their theory is, oils that are exposed to air, while being stored, like on our kitchen counters, are oxidizing. That is they’re literally going rancid. Maybe not to our taste but they are turning on the molecular level. Ingesting these oxidized oils introduce free radicals to the body. Plus there is inflammation that goes along in the bargain. So unless I can get olive oil fresh off the press, I’ve eliminated it from my diet. Where I used oil before for cooking I now use butter and for salads I use only acids like vinegar or fresh citrus. Testosterone production, like all of the body’s bio-chemical systems need essential nutrients every day in order to function properly. Getting these nutrients solely from food is not possible in 2013. We must supplement. And two-thirds of our essentials are minerals. Testosterone needs minerals, vitamins, protein and fat, saturated fat from things like fish, red meat, dairy and butter. But we gotta eat, right? Right. Then choosing what really works with the body and eliminate foods that don’t work will increase our absorptive capacity and we win. Also, walking away from gov’t and MD-directed food mythology is essential. Thanks for the list, the rest of the items work for me!Thank you Michael for the thoughtful post, you bring up some great things to think about and I’m going to take a look at it!
-Dr. Edward GroupA lot of people will take zinc supplements in order to increase their testosterone levels. If you do supplement with zinc, make sure you are also taking copper supplements as well. The work in the body as a team so taking one at a higher level than the other can do more harm than good!Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()
