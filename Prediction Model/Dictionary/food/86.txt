    The traditional green bean casserole has become an uninspired, uneaten dish at many a holiday gathering. Mix things up with this fresh green bean salad from Brooklyn Supper. This is a great side dish to make ahead of time because it needs to marinate in the dressing. The basil, garlic, and balsamic vinaigrette make this a wonderfully aromatic salad that will keep for about 2 days.        Red cabbage is healthier than you might think. This humble cruciferous vegetable is a  that contains powerful antioxidants and helps boost the immune system. Red cabbage, in particular, is packed with antioxidant  called anthocyanins. There are actually 18 different anthocyanins in the purple vegetable and they offer a range of health benefits. In addition to their free radical mitigating abilities, anthocyanins also act as anti-inflammatories and decrease your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Further, they protect the integrity of your DNA and boost the production of cytokines, which are immune response proteins.    Glucosinolates are another phytonutrient found in red cabbage and other cruciferous vegetables like Brussels sprouts and broccoli. Glucosinolates are broken down into isothiocyanates in the body. These altered phytonutrients (and the various compounds they’re further broken down into) support the lungs, liver, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon.    Both red and green cabbage contain phytonutrients that promote immune function in the small intestine. AhR ligands are phytonutrients derived from cruciferous vegetables and they activate the immune cells in the intestinal wall where nutrients are absorbed. These immune cells, called intraepithelial lymphocytes, defend against microbial invasion and promote healthy immune function in the intestines. When you don’t get enough cruciferous vegetables in your diet, your intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte cell count can drop, so you definitely want to make sure you’re eating your cabbage!
