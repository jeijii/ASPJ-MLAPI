Despite of being promoted as “raw”, they are NOT. FDA is forcing the farmers to PASTEURIZE them. So, these almonds are not raw anymore, they are dead almonds, with no nutritional value. Look for almonds from other sources in US, and imported. That includes also  almond milk of course.
Don’t trust whole foods market too much. A lot of their products are not organic, including vegetables and fruits. They are clearly labeled.To all the “nut lovers” out there:
I consider myself the “worst of all, but research “phytic acid” and “oxalic acid” content of raw nuts and seeds!!!
– raw nuts and seeds contain “anti nutrients” which prevent untimely sprouting and being “exterminated” by all the nut lovers like insects, animals and us included
– If you eat raw nuts and nut butters daily, in larger amounts, you SHOULD soak the raw nuts and seeds in warm water with a couple of teaspoons of seasalt over night and then thorougly rinse, drip dry and dehydrate in the oven  at about 150 degrees Fahrenheit
– Wilderness Family sells nutbutters from soaked and dehydrated nuts, but it is spendy!
– Phytic acid depletes your body of important minerals like iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc! And vegetarians are especially at risk and “raw foodists”!
– Traditional ways of preparing those foods need to be observed and re-learned – there is great wisdom and knowledge there – soaking, sprouting, fermenting reduce phytic acid to a tolerable level and increase the phytase content (enzyme which “breaks down” phytic acid) – that’s why sour dough bread is health wise far superior to yeast leavened bread!
Just thought you should all know!
Great source are the Weston A. Price Foundation magazines!
