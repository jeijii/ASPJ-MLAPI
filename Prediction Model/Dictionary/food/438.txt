    Eating foods that can help you maintain a healthy heart, lower your cholesterol, and balance your blood pressure is important to preserving a high quality of life. Nutrient-dense nuts like walnuts, chestnuts, and pecans are recognized as an important component of any heart-healthy diet. And while these three nuts may help prevent heart disease and keep low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol low, pecans may be the best. Here’s why…        As a low-calorie snack or with meals, whether whole or in halves, pecans pack a potent punch of nutrients. They deliver protein, vitamins, minerals, healthy polyunsaturated fats, and antioxidants. All of this combines to support your overall health.    Minerals like  and zinc help to lower blood glucose levels and stimulate your metabolism. This keeps your blood sugar low and helps offset a high-sugar diet. These are important dietary and nutrient considerations to help address blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. The combination of nutrients also contributes to anti-inflammatory effects.    As you process sugar faster, you burn more energy, which is a key factor in weight loss. Studies have found that people who eat nuts like pecans lose weight and keep it off easier than those who don’t.  French scientists have also found that antioxidants like those in pecans slow the aging process.     The polyunsaturated fatty acids, or PUFAs as researchers call them, feed your brain. These PUFAs play a key role in the health of brain cells. As you get older, you need to get enough of these fatty acids to stay mentally sharp, preserve your memory, and avoid degenerative diseases like dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease.

Although it’d be way too overzealous to call pecans a cure for cancer, it is interesting that researchers at Purdue University found gamma-tocopherol, a form of vitamin E found in pecans, interrupts the formation of prostate and lung cancer cells.     Men and women who eat nuts have fewer incidences of heart attacks and heart disease, according to the British Journal of Nutrition.  On their own, pecans offer complete cardiovascular support.      If you need to get your LDL cholesterol under control, pecans are a perfect addition to your diet.    In one study, participants in a treatment group ate 68 grams of pecans daily for 8 weeks. At the end of the study period, total cholesterol levels were significantly lower with noticeable increases in fiber, magnesium, and overall energy.     An additional study conducted by researchers at Loma Linda University and published in the  determined that gamma tocopherols in pecans contributed to lower LDL cholesterol a short time after consumption. At three hours after eating whole pecans, levels of oxidized (or bad) LDL fell by 33%. The effect was observed to have lasted at least eight hours.     In addition to cholesterol-lowering effects, pecans (and nuts in general) help to keep blood pressure lower and more stable. A review of 21 studies published in the  found tree nuts, including pecans, .

If we are careful not to cook the nuts too much will the roasting destroy much of their goodness?
