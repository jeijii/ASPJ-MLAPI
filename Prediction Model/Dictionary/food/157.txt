I have sensitive combination skin, the only trouble is that it’s prone to shining – but the Lady Soma Renewal Serum solved this. Well, this serum is something completely different – but it’s the first time that skin product gave me some noticeable results. Skin seems … well, just better, sort of more alive. Besides, (not very dark) pigmentation I had for years gradually disappeared after a few months of using this serum.

When my husband smelt it on me he liked the smell so much that he tried it – and from that day he’s stealing it on regular basis. He has dry, but not sensitive skin and adores it.Hi I have a sunburn on my face and I have read som where that taking Vitamin C can help in recovering.
