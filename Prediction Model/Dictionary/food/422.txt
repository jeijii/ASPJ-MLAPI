I’ve written before about the dangers of soft drink addiction… which sounds like it could even be a joke. How many times have you heard someone refer to themselves as a “cokeaholic”? The truth is, soda addiction is no laughing matter. The chemicals in soft drinks are not only habit forming, but highly addictive. And that’s exactly what the big soda companies want. Let’s take a deeper look at some of the negative health effects of soda        Back in 2002,  described the problem with soda in her article “Soft Drinks: America’s Other Drinking Problem.”     So you decide to be responsible and limit the amount of soda your family consumes. Well, big soda has ways to deal with troublemakers like you. They’ve taken steps to cut you out of the equation and peddle their product directly to your kids, ensuring they get the full effect –  – at a young age.      Have you noticed your kids’ school has more soda machines than yours did when you were a kid? There’s a reason for that, and it’s ugly — the major soft drink companies are targeting schools. Since the 1990’s, most schools in the United States have had to deal with painful budget cuts. They must decide between slashing programs or selling out to marketing campaigns. It’s common for schools to have exclusive contracts with major soda companies that doesn’t include healthy alternatives to soda, like .As you may guess, allowing children unrestricted access to liquid candy is not without health consequences.And that’s not all. Forty-four grams of high fructose corn syrup per serving is bad, but “sugar-free”  is even worse. Diet soda usually contains the artificial sweetener aspartame. Aspartame is a dangerous chemical and neurotoxin that metabolizes into formaldehyde and, in my opinion, is one of the worst artificial sweeteners on the market.If pushers of liquid candy and hazardous chemicals have already infiltrated our schools, what options do we have?

I’m particularly also split between the dilemma of affording kids proper schooling versus supporting proper health habits. It’s really a shame so many schools have had to “sell their souls” as you say.Parents are not helpless in this situation. If soda is sold in your child’s school and the child expresses a desire for funds to purchase soda, a little explanation of the dangers of soft drinks is in order. This explanation, along with offering alternatives at home and serving as a role model and consuming no soda at home should suffice.I have always drunk more soda than I should. I especially liked the colas, which I know are hard on the teeth, esophagus and on general health. Since around the past five years, I have noticed that most regular sodas have a bitter, or diet taste to them, especially the ones at the fast food restaurants. Some where I heard or read that they about that time were switching to a new high fructose corn syrup, a different ratio or something like that. I even tried some Shasta brand, which has less calories but a sucralose added to it.  If the companies have all switched to these new ingredients, I think we should all quit drinking this stuff.  Who knows what is in these drinks?  GMO beet sugar is bad enough and may also be one of the bitter tastes detected.I’m not sure about taxation, or trusting government to manage. Prefer education.
