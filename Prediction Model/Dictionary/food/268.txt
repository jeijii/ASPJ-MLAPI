Mulberries are delicious and nutritious, people all over the world enjoy it.  Mulberries are a product of the Morus alba tree. Its leaves, which also contain nutrients and are even used as food for silkworms, are thin, glossy and light green; the fruit, like grapes, is red or white and grows in bunches called ‚Äúdrupes.‚Äù  Antioxidants help lessen the damage caused by free radicals and the entire mulberry plant- leaves, stems, and fruit, contains antioxidants.   One antioxidant in particular, resveratrol, has gotten much attention. Research published by the University of Texas Health Science Center credits resveratrol for positive effects on age and longevity.   Mulberries contain alkaloids that activate macrophages. Macrophages are white blood cells that stimulate the immune system, putting it on high active alert against health threats.     More formal research is appropriate, but mulberry is thought to contain compounds that support balanced blood sugar levels.  Traditional medicine in China, Trinidad and Tobago have all used mulberry leaves to promote balanced blood sugar levels.      Dried mulberries are a great source of protein, vitamin C and K, fiber, and iron. Best of all, they‚Äôre available in health food stores everywhere! Enjoy them as a great snack all by themselves or add them to your favorite trail mix. If you live in a warm climate and are lucky enough to have mulberry trees nearby, you can enjoy the fruit fresh off the tree. Not as tasty as the fruit, even the leaves contain protein, fiber, and nutrients!     Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine have used mulberry as a remedy for swelling and redness.  A recent Romanian study discovered that a curcumin and mulberry leaf combination may be a new lead into natural remedies for this sort of irritation.     Do mulberries offer anything to the brain?  Researchers at Khon Kaen University in Thailand set out to answer that question by evaluating the effect of mulberry on male rats with memory impairment and brain damage.  Although further investigation is required before mulberries can be declared a cognitive enhancer and neuroprotectant, rats that consumed mulberries had better memories and less oxidative stress.
