       is on the rise, and the ‘disorder’ is now affecting many adults.  With such an influx of new diagnoses each day, many people might be wondering what is causing it. As with any disorder there is a likely contributor, or a multitude of contributors. While it could be any number of things, chemicals could be a very likely factor in ADHD diagnosis.

Studies suggest its substitute bisphenol-S, or BPS, could be just as bad for your health.

While  could be linked to a higher risk of ADHD symptoms in children, eating more fish could possibly lower that same risk.  It’s all about balance and finding fish that carry a low mercury burden.    One study suggests prenatal exposure to  can increase the risk for ADHD in kids.  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are emitted by burning fossil fuels, so completely avoiding them can be quite difficult. But limiting your exposure could be the answer since “children born to mothers with higher levels of PAH during pregnancy had five-fold increased odds of showing symptoms of ADHD than those who were born to mothers with lower levels.”    For some children with ADHD, switching to foods without artificial coloring has helped manage symptoms, leading some researchers to .  Unfortunately, products in the U.S. are not required to have a disclaimer connecting attention problems in children and dye consumption; however, some companies are shaping up when it comes to dyes.
