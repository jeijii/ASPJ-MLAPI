    Toxins are all around us, and while we already know how harmful they can be, have you stopped to think about what they can do to the brain? Studies suggest neurotoxins impede brain development in kids, something that might also lead to , autism, or Parkinson’s later in life.   Keeping your brain free from toxin exposure could go a long way in boosting overall brain health.        If you’re having trouble concentrating, thinking clearly, or even relaxing your mind, your brain may have invasive forces trying to impede your health. Here are 4 reasons that could explain your brain fog.    The body releases cortisol during ; small bursts can help us manage things during these times. The problem comes in when the body is in a constant stressed-out state.  If a pregnant woman were stressed from poverty, for example, cortisol could ‘“get through the placenta into the fetus, potentially influencing her baby’s brain and tampering with its circuitry.” After birth, the child’s cortisol could, then, continue to sabotage brain development.    One study suggests traffic pollution could be responsible for lower memory test scores and slower cognitive development in kids.   But, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) aren’t only from ; they’re also products of everything from burning coal to tobacco smoke, so avoiding them completely might be easier said than done. You can definitely take steps to limit your exposure though.    BPA is such a nasty toxin that many manufacturers have started making BPA-free products; however, some studies say its substitute bisphenol-S, or BPS, could be just as bad for your brain health, suggesting  exposure could be linked to altered brain growth and hyperactivity.  And always be careful when buying food; there are still a lot of canned goods out there that still use BPA in the linings of cans.     A new study even suggests type 2 diabetes “is associated with worse performance on cognitive tests measuring abilities involved in the control of emotions, behaviors and thought.”  Because doctors encourage self-management (diet, blood sugar, medication) and many patients already burn out when it comes to managing the disease, this loss of executive function is worrisome, to say the least.    So if you find yourself feeling foggy, there are things you can do. First things first: get outdoors. One study even found being outside was linked to positive cognitive development in kids.  That sounds like a great idea for all ages! Another easy thing is . There’s lots of research that suggests our gut health is directly connected to our mental health.
