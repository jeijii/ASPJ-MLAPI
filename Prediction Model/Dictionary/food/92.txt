    Substituting your bland oatmeal for this indulgent peach porridge is a flavorful way to kick off your day. Mediterranean food is tempting and healthy, and this authentic Greek barley recipe from  is no exception. Roasted peaches, maple syrup, orange juice, cinnamon, cardamom, and barley come together beautifully in this sweet treat that’s perfect for breakfast, dessert, or a side dish! I recommend portioning servings into containers for a great post-workout snack to cool you down or combat the summer heat.        This recipe will produce three servings, each under 220 calories but high in fiber and loaded with manganese, , thiamin and vitamin B6. Following the Mediterranean-style diet can reduce your risk of health problems later in life because it emphasizes eating healthy plant foods, fiber, whole grains like barley, legumes, , and olives.  Barley is a healthy, versatile grain and a great pantry staple. Incorporating barley recipes into your weekly meal plan is a great strategy for encouraging normal cholesterol and blood pressure. Barley is also a great source of fiber — 31.8 grams of fiber in a single cup!    I hope you enjoy this authentic Greek recipe as much as we did. Let us know what you think in the comments!
