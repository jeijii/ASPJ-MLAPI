What a wonderful candy treat that is mostly healthy (except for the sugar). I cut the rind in 8ths or smaller, rinse and put in a pot of water covering the peels.

I started by peeling the oranges, which grow in my yard and the yards of my neighbors, and throwing them whole into my Osterizer blender; my Vitamix having been left at my own home. The positive effects were immediate. I have more energy, my digestion improved, my poo improved, and most importantly, I donâ€™t get sore from my Brazilian Jiujutsu training sessions! I started adding a whole orange, including the peel, into these smoothies a week ago. There have been no negative effects. If there have been any positive effects, I canâ€™t  tell. Now, I have to find a way to live near a constant supply of organically grown oranges! I go through 50 each week.
