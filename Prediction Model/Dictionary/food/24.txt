I had so many that I dried and crushed them into powder. I decided to  get my daily dose by adding the powder to small empty pill capsules. I only use a small bit in combination with tumeric & cinnamon, 1:3 ratio. It has definitely helped with appetite & energy.

But I’ve found this to be an easy way to get use out of my peppers and get my daily dose as well!Pingback: ()
