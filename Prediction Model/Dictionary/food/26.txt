Thanks!Ironic, some people on one of my forums were just asking about this the other day, then I pop in here to find this post today. Good info, I knew some benefits but this opened my mind to it a bit more!Thank you for spreading the word! I use coconut oil in place of butter (I can‚Äôt do dairy) as well as a facial moisturizer.Never knew that coconut oil was so beneficial‚Ä¶ thanks, I think i‚Äôm gonna try it!Great blog post!I learned about coconut oil a few years back and now prefer it because of the way it cooks as well as the knowledge I‚Äôm boosting my immune system.  Anything I cook with coconut oil turns out a gorgeous colour. It‚Äôs amazing for roasted potatoes and I put a dollop in the cooking water when I‚Äôm making rice. I use it as much as possible. My husband didn‚Äôt want me to cook with it for his food because he was worried it would change the flavour of the food but it doesn‚Äôt taste like coconut at all.And it also makes a fantastic (relatively inexpensive) natural lubricant which doubles as a moisturizer!I‚Äôm curious how much of this one should try to use a day.  And other than cooking and smoothies any other clever uses?  I tried taking 1 tbsp per day for a while, I didn‚Äôt really notice any difference however I‚Äôm open to trying again- the benefits are hard to pass up.I use organic coconut oil in many of my hand made soaps and shampoos.

I put it on the top of his head and all over his body, paying special attention to the ‚ÄúHORRIBLE‚Äù areas and making sure I coated them several times. I put socks on him so he didn‚Äôt wipe off the coconut oil.The next morning, I combed the cradle cap out of his head. It never even bled and it NEVER CAME BACK! The eczema was ALMOST GONE! I was a slight pink color and only felt like sand paper. I slathered him two more times during the day and before he went to bed. The next morning, the eczema was GONE! It does come back if you don‚Äôt continue to use the coconut oil as a moisturizer though.Susan,

Having said that, if you are a newbie with coconut products a good way to start is just by adding a spoon full of virgin coconut oil to your daily cup of coffee (no need for sugar).

I‚Äôve been suffering from eczema all my life and I just can‚Äôt stand it anymore. I‚Äôve been using VCO for nearly a month now and I don‚Äôt see improvement ;( although VCO is supposed to be a great moisturiser I find that it doesn‚Äôt moisturise my skin well (eczema parts) I‚Äôm wondering if should take it internally instead.

The benefits of using Coconut Oil has really taken off over the past couple of years. I started imported Organic Virgin Coconut Oil from Sri Lanka after my visit to the country in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami to help with emergency relief work.My mother and my son have both had luck with a moisturizer called U-Lactin.  We but it through the dermatologist, but they also have a website.  Good luck!That is a good brand, yes.-Dr. G.Hello, I have a son that had bad eczema all over his arms & around his mouth.  He wanted it gone so I tried Apple Cider Vinegar put in his bath water.  I had him stop taking the showers and add 3-4 cups of the vinegar to a warm bath every other night or at least 2 times a week.  I told him to make sure all his affected body parts were submerged for at least 15-20 min. and to just soak.  He did this and to our surprise it worked wonderfully.  After that he went to live w/his father & stopped doing it because I was not preparing the bath for him.  Anyway it all came back.  He started doing it on his own & it got under control.  No more dry itching, broken inflamed skin.  It healed, now he is 26 & he uses it still for control of it.  Plus, my granddaughter has it too.  She gets the bath soaks too.  However, the ratio of vinegar is different due to using less water.  We use 2 cups cause she is small & a half tub is all thats needed.  It works for us.  Any kind will do.  Even the Generic.  However, it must be the Apple Cider kind.  Hope this helps you!This is so good I have sjogrens an autoimmune disorder and this knowledge is so good thank youVery good read‚Ä¶ some of you might also want to try making your own deodorant using approximately 1.5 parts coconut oil, 1 part baking soda, and 1 part cornstarch‚Ä¶ cornstarch absorbs sweat, baking soda neutralizes odors, and coconut oil, as stated in this article, is antibacterial, so it prevents body odor too. also, it smells great. you can mix in a couple drops of your favorite essential oil for added fragrance if you‚Äôd like. Not only does this homemade deodorant save money, but it has less toxins than storebought deodorant and leaves way less residue on your skin and clothes. In addition, I‚Äôve noticed insects are less attracted to my armpits now :pforgot to add that I always considered myself an abnormally sweaty person. But despite the fact that this recipe is for deodorant and that storebought deodorant is also an antiperspirant, my armpits sweat *much much much less* now that I use this recipe instead of buying deodorant.is it as good or better to just eat organic coconut?I have Sjogrens and I ‚Äúswish‚Äù the coconut oil in my mouth for about 15-20 mins twice a day and then spit it out into the garbage.
