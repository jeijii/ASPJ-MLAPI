      Do you know about the secret ingredient in red wine? Resveratrol can help support normal cholesterol and combat obesity and much more! In fact, a study recently suggested it can even reduce heart disease by limiting the “formation of inflammatory factors”—possibly slowing it down before it becomes a problem.  Don’t think  will make you instantly healthy, and always make sure you get all the heart-healthy benefits by exercising (not while drinking, of course).         Red wine is a powerful food that, in moderation, could provide numerous health benefits. Here are 4 surprising health benefits of red wine.    Just about all of us would agree that good dental health is a priority. While many communities still  for dental health, the effects are limited and also potentially harmful. So it’s great to hear that a little red wine could have the same effect. A new study even suggested it could even help fight cavities by preventing bacterial growth.     A study suggested a glass of red wine could lead to a happier, more relaxed mood and could also increase facial flushing.  Sort of a no brainer, right? Well, here’s where it gets interesting. These things can make you more attractive in the eyes of your partner. While not a physical health benefit, I think most of us would agree that’s a definite emotional perk.    One recent study suggested the anti-inflammatory properties of resveratrol could even help with depression.  With almost 148 million people in the U.S. battling some form of depression, this news could be huge—maybe even leading more scientists to study the connection between natural anti-inflammatories and depression.    We all know that drinking alcohol damages cells in the body but some research shows that resveratrol can actually attack and kill those damaged cells.  In a recent study, resveratrol in red wine counteracted the effects of alcohol, leading to a lower cancer rate. Anything that can help in cancer prevention is definitely a beautiful thing!    Remember how I mentioned earlier that resveratrol could help combat obesity? There’s recent evidence suggesting a glass of wine a day could help overweight people burn fat faster.  That’s not to say red wine is a total freebie. You can’t just drink all you like; there will always be risks with that kind of behavior, but there’s an argument to be had for the idea that red wine in moderation has the potential to do a lot of good.  Remember though, red wine is not the only source for resveratrol; you can also find it in things like certain nuts and berries, and nutritional supplements.    How do you get your resveratrol?

Along with other fruits, I eat them every day.I have read that port wine is much higher in reveratrol than other red wines, some of which can have only minuscule amounts. As far as worrying about calories… You’re much wiser to count chemicals over counting calories. Processed food (empty calories), wheat, and primarily sugar is what is causing the fat and diabetes epidemic. If you want to lose weight crowd those things out with better choices. One must find a good source for your wine. Many off the shelf wines are full of garbage. Know your winemaker for good healthy wine!
