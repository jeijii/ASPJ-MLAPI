To enrich something means to make it richer by adding good things to it. If you add some organic  to your water, you’ve enriched it with enzymes and B vitamins. Enriched  must have lots of good things added to it, so it’s good for you. Right? Not quite.The reality is that many of the good things that were originally in the flour, like fiber and phytonutrients, have been stripped out through extensive chemical and mechanical processing. Processing removes 20 essential nutrients—a mere 5 are added to the finished product.  The added nutrients are iron, thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (b3), and folic acid (B9). But these aren’t natural vitamins and minerals added to the flour. The forms added to enriched processed flour are often created in labs or harvested from soil, rather than grown in nature.There’s a common misconception that enriched flour is not that bad for you, it’s just not as good for you as whole wheat. After all, the flour producer did add some nutrients back to it. But this flour is not neutral—it’s actively harming your health. Consuming enriched flour products is like eating pure sugar and popping a multivitamin.What sets enriched white fiber apart from whole wheat fiber is which parts of the wheat berry make it into the flour. White flour has a very  because it contains only the endosperm, or starchy component of the wheat berry. Whole wheat flour contains the whole wheat berry, including the bran, germ, and the endosperm.Enriched white flour is not absorbed into the body like whole grains. When you eat refined flour, your digestive system quickly and easily breaks down and absorbs it like . This causes your blood sugar to spike, which activates insulin, a hormone that herds all those free sugar molecules into cells, causing your blood sugar to drop.A drop in blood sugar is actually the best case scenario. Over time, these cycles can lead to weight gain and insulin resistance. During this time, you still produce insulin, but it’s no longer able to send sugar into your cells. You’re left with dangerously high blood sugar, which leads to blood vessel damage, increased oxidative stress, and depleted antioxidant activity, while contributing to high blood pressure.On the other end of the spectrum, whole grains are absorbed from the digestive tract slowly because they contain both types of fiber and a wide range of phytonutrients. The fiber and nutrients help maintain your blood sugar, help you feel full for longer, preserve your insulin sensitivity, and protect you from a slew of diet-related diseases. Refined flour does the opposite. It increases the risk and incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers.Many foods are made with flour of some type, and it’s not easy to go completely flour-free without switching to an all-produce, whole food, or .Fortunately, there are many alternatives to enriched white flour if you’re not yet ready to switch to a flour-free diet. Try replacing enriched flour with whole wheat or rye flour. You could even try to go gluten-free. Oat flour, almond meal, chickpea meal, coconut flour, brown rice flour, or millet flour are all excellent gluten-free options with a wealth of health benefits. Pasta, bread, and baked goods are the foods that most commonly contain white flour, but pay attention to food labels—many processed and frozen foods also contain enriched flour.If available, organic, sprouted flours are best. Organic sprouted whole grain pastas and breads are much more common today than just a few years ago. Of course, the best diet plan would contain little to no processed grains and included more fresh fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, and vegetables. You can also try incorporating enzymes, like proteases, to help your body break down the protein in flour. I personally recommend  to keep your digestive system functioning well when eating foods that contain gluten.

If it says “enriched flour” at the top, put it back and look for something else. Because of this, I’ve discovered that alot of the breads that say “whole wheat”, even list “enriched flour” as an ingredient.  So you really have to look closely at what you are buying. I’m a big believer of eating whole wheat breads and pastas. Fiber is very important for overall health. I believe it’s the “key to your health”. Great article Dr. G!I  like this type of food.Do you have a source for the statement that nutritionally unsuitable metallic iron is used to enrich bleached flour?  The FDA guideline for enriched flour () specifically requires that “All ingredients from which the food is fabricated shall be safe and suitable.”I am so glad to see so much of what I believe in, in black and white where I can copy it and give to my friends. I had cancer 3 years ago and was healed by vitamins and such and I learned so much from a nutritionalist. I preach and preach but I like to have it where I can copy it to show to everyone.
Finally I am finding more and more of what I believe in so strongly.BarbyThere is still a lot baked goods that I avoid because of the white flour content. I expose myself every Sunday in the church’s coffee room after service when I snack on an old favorite such as gingerbread or some other thing that I used to eat when I was a kid. I no longer drink coffee and now use Himalayan Gree Tea which 99.95+/- caffeine-free. No longer young at 72+.When a product says that it has whole grains in it you can’t always believe them.  If you look to the ingredients you will most likely see enriched flour as the first ingredient.  There is a stamp that you can find on the product that shows that it IS whole grain.  Take time to check the ingredients on the product and you will be able to find whole wheat products.  Even better, make your own bread and grind your own flour and you will be much better off!You are right.  Iron in a metallic form is not added.  The type of iron added to bakery goods is usually iron sulfate which is a water soluble form of iron that is identical to the medicinal iron sulfate taken by most women to replace iron loss in their blood stream.  Iron filings in cereal would be a “mistake” and not the result of deliberate formulation.  This reference is just more hysteria to make better reading.I eat very healthy. Lots of fish, chicken breast, greens, fruits and vegetables. I must stear away from food made with enriched flour if I don’t want to feel sluggish, depressed, tired, agressive and have flatulence.Since I have stayed away from foods containing enriched flour; I have never felt so energetic. Lots of fruits, vegetables, greens, fish, chicken and lots of water. Staying away from enriched flour has also helped me take off the last few pounds I had to lose. I am 63 years old but I feel like 40. And also by eating well, I look much younger. Most people think I’m in my 40’s.That is Wonderful!  Hi I’m an ILS worker and have been working on getting all my clients off enriched and processed foods.  I myself stopped purchasing them about 6 months ago and have lost 35 lbs. and feel great.  Most people can’t believe how much I weigh (210), they think I weigh 170.  Funny tho, I wear cloths that fit me when I weighed 190.  America should ban all enriched and processed foods and shut some hospitals down.
Thanks,
ByronWOW! I honestly had no idea that enriched white flour was so bad for you. I am going to eat nothing but wheat bread from now on. THanks for the info!How do you grind flour?i eat white flour i have a birth mark of it i eats it 2r 3 times ady but a time i dont swallow it  an that other times i spit itout please help me wit i please com up wit some kind of solution.The dr said plenty of good stuff. However since I and no one else is perfect, so too is this report lacking something.  The choosing between wheat flour or white flour (enriched or not), is made moot due to the rarely spoke of fact that bread sits in an oven at 350 degrees Farenheit for an hour. No nutrients are surviving that. To be clear; no nutrients that are the same as the original stalk of wheat are in the slice of bread. This is true for pasta as well. The processes that caused the flour to be devalued nutritionally in the mills, are far less severe than those in the kitchen. As the good doc recommended get get all your nutrients from fruits and salads and nuts and seeds etc.Bonnie, you really need to work on your grammer, spelling and sentence structure.  AAHHHH!!!!!! this is terrible.  How did you pass school?I bought Whole Wheat bread and the second ingredient was High Fructose Corn Syrup. Have to read the Ingredients closely!stop buying cheap weat breadYou can buy wheat/grain grinder/mills at any Bosch store; other stores sell them as well.  I used to grind my own whole wheat flour years ago.  I gave it up when I had to start working full-time to make ends meet.  The grinder went to my daughter.  It is best to grind only enough wheat to make enough flour for the batch of bread you are making.  The flour loosing its nutrients as it sits in your cupboard.  I also used to use the whole wheat flour to make gluten–and I used it as a meat substitute in a lot of recipes.  The kids loved my meatless chicken-fried steak!I was told by a nutritionist that using a cast-iron pan to cook in could give you your daily requirement of iron.  The reasoning was that the food absorbed iron from the pan.  Are you telling me that is false?Louise,
Thank you for your post!  You may not receive the RDA by cooking with cast iron cookware but it is possible that you will absorbe some iron from this form of cooking.  This can be said of pots that are not coated with non stick or painted ceramic, in most cases the older cast iron cookware is safer to use.  So yes, you will get some of the iron, but be sure that you are getting exactly what the body needs before assuming that this will be the “one source” you will need over all.Rick…it’s spelled grammar. Ouch. Let’s not judge and let’s stick to the topic.ok your all wrong about everything your writing, because everything your writing is only 2% of the truth. The truth is all flour available on the market today is enriched, whole wheat is really no different than white flour the only difference is it has a small amount of bran added back into it after the refining process. Also there is no part of the germ what so ever present in any flour anywhere in the world (Unless your buying your flour from a mill that milled it that day. I really don’t feel like laying this down right now but I gonna not be lazy and do it any way. THIS IS WHAT YOU UNEDUCATED HEALTH NUTS DONT KNOW. In 1873 there were over 22,000 flour mills in the US alone
Today there are less than 200.
WHY?
Because those those of you who have ever milled grain and i mean any grain and leave it sit in a for 7 days it smells like a dead body.
It goes bad. So back then mills only milled enough grain for the day to meet the demand of the people in the area.The bran is the exterior shell and the wheat grain it is made up of many nutrient rich layers. More importantly it protects the vital nutrients inside the the grain. Once the bran has been cracked or broken the inner elements are exposed to oxygen, which destroys the element in a short period of time.Within 24 hours of the brain being cracked 40% of the vitamins and minerals have been oxidized. After 72 hours 90% of the nutrients have been destroyed.
This is the reason why they enrich flour, because they started replacing 6 out of 29 essential vitamins minerals and oils found naturally in ground ground in the early 20th century because of a number of health issues people where facing during the time that they associated with the lack of these nutrients in the bread. Now bleaching, bromorating, and the ultra violent unnatural process in which all breads are made today is way to much for me to get into right now so do your own research it wont take more then 30 mins. Boromorating is illegal in the UK, Western Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan because it is considered a  carcinogen. You will read things that says nobody in america uses boramorated flour anymore but I assure you, from your local pizzeria and bakery to the grocery store brands they all do. I own 2 pizzerias and a bakery I know. Read the rest for yourselves.Ok so what have we got from all this?
Flour and bread and glutens are baaaadddd?
NOOOOO
Everything is bad, from GMOs to HFCS to Preservatives to literally ever fruit, vegtable, meat, and grain that is not brought directally from a small locale farmer its really bad or its empty. You cant say I gonna stop eating grain to be healthy So whats the solution?Buy a mill there cheap grind your own flour as you need it.Now for the second Part
Natural yeast
Im gonna copy and paste something now cause im not a writer i dont have the paticents for it and im not good at It sooooo
 P.S. this artical is half BS as well meaning its only half the story. Every hardworking American in this country whether you work 12hours a day or none has the time to make bread trust me for those who want more info email me or respond to this.Of course the sourdough fermentation of flour from whole wheat and
rye to make bread has strong traditions in several countries of the
world, whether the breads are leavened, oven-baked loaves or flat
leavened breads cooked over hot coals. This method is time-consuming
and–even more problematic for the modern age–requires the careful
maintenance of a culture medium, the sourdough starter, which is a
stable relationship of a family of wild yeast fungi and several strains
of local lactobacilli. Rather like the carefully nurtured cultures and
caves that produce delectable fermented cheeses, sourdough bread
cultures are a product of place and the people who care for them and use
 them. They are all different, produce flavors and rates of fermentation
 peculiar and beloved unto themselves, require temperatures and other
conditions known intimately and respected by the baker. Commercial
baker’s yeast, on the other hand, is a monoculture of just one single
variety of yeast, grown to be a consistently fast and vigorous
replicator and producer of carbon dioxide, but incapable of developing
grain flavors (the lactobacilli are best at that). Sourdough cultures
produce reliably leavened and complexly flavored breads via the
alchemical communion of the culture microorganisms, flour, water, fire
and time–plenty of time.Michael Gaenzle, a cereal microbiologist now at the University of
Alberta, Canada, has suggested that sourdough cultures are in fact so
intimately connected with the people who use them that they form a
mutually supportive and sustaining relationship.7 That is,
the microorganisms are part of you (and come from you) and so the bread
you ferment with them is tailormade to nourish and support especially
you. You bolster your own health by eating bread cultured with your
domestic friendly “beasties.” This “home advantage” is an obvious
traditional benefit conferred on newly married daughters whose mothers
included a barrel of sourdough in the wedding dowry to start their new
households–to ensure their daughters’ health and vigor (especially since
 they were soon likely to bear children) and provide them extra strength
 in their new positions in life.The traditional sourdough process reliably neutralizes the
anti-nutrients in the cereal grains as the flour is kept moist and
acidic for many hours (or days). Ongoing research in cereal microbiology
 is investigating some preliminary evidence that the traditional
sourdough method may also sever the bonds of the “toxic” peptides in
wheat gluten responsible for the celiac reaction and neutralize them as
well.8 In short, certain lactobacilli in a sourdough culture
acting on wheat flour for a 24-hour period achieved nearly complete
digestion of the peptides. When bread made with these species was fed to
 recovered celiac patients for two days, the patients showed no signs of
 increased intestinal permeability that were found among recovered
celiac patients who consumed the same amount of regular bread over the
same time period. These intriguing results suggest that wheat (or rye)
flour that has undergone 24 hours of culture fermentation may render the
 “toxic” peptides harmless and allow the bread to be safely eaten by
those with celiac disease, although studies of celiac patients consuming
 sourdough breads for a much longer period of time will be needed to
confirm this.In the study cited, test bread was made with fermented wheat flour
and the remainder of the flour from the non-gluten grains millet,
buckwheat and oats. The recipe does not resemble a classically prepared
sourdough bread which is traditionally made in a building-up process of
stages; some of the flour will have fermented for as long as two or
three days, whereas some of it for only several hours prior to baking,
during the period when the culture microorganisms experience exponential
 growth rate. The result of breaking down gluten completely is that it
can no longer raise the dough!Deviation from Rational PrinciplesAnother outcome of the mass production of industrial bakery products
has been to create grotesque taste standards and expectations that have
no connection to an honest ingredient. Commercial cereal products have
become health hazards because of everything from grain hybridization to
flour adulteration to inadequate, inappropriate and violent processing.
They also are aesthetically repugnant, which is just as important a
factor to consider when talking about the nourishment of food.Consider this prophetic statement by Rudolf Steiner in an address to
members of the Anthroposophical Society on June 20, 1924 and published
in Spiritual Foundations for the Renewal of Agriculture: “. . .
 [U]nder the influence of our modern philosophy of materialism, it is
agriculture–believe it or not–that has deviated furthest from any truly
rational principles. Indeed, not many people know that during the last
few decades the agricultural products on which our life depends have
degenerated extremely rapidly. In this present time of transition. . .
it is not only human moral development that is degenerating, but also
what human activity has made of the Earth and what lies just above the
Earth. . . Even materialistic farmers nowadays. . . can calculate in how
 many decades their products will have degenerated to such an extent
that they no longer serve as human nourishment. It will certainly be
within this century.”Grains comprise a wholesome category of foods that must be respected
for the complexity of nutrient contributions they can make to the human
diet, and must always be prepared with care to maximize those nutrients’
 availability as well as neutralize naturally occurring antinutrients.
Resources also exist to reintroduce ancient grains, such as emmer and
einkorn wheats, into our food supply and diversify cereal choices with
alternatives to the few overly hybridized cultivars largely in use
today.Growing and preparing food ought to be a sacramental service. It
should not be based on violence, as is most of modern agriculture,
factory animal farms and factories that produce finished food items like
 bread. All those processes are based on “conquering” the food item and
forcing it into a form defined by commerce. There are no more subtle
energies in these debased foods, let alone mere measureable nutrients or
 soul-satisfying taste and vitality.Food is holy. Its preparation and enjoyment constitute a daily opportunity to experience happiness, satisfaction and gratitude.

Not only has it helped me lose weight, but it really helps with sugar cravings. White breads get me off track and make me want sugar.I would like to hear everyone’s comments about the phytic acid that is in whole grain products.The advice in this piece is very outdated.  If we were living in 1992, sure, this article would be “refreshing.”  However, nowadays, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that any type of wheat products, because of the modifications made to the grain which has increased its gluten content, are very detrimental to the health of man.
In short, even whole wheat is bad because of  the toxic proteins.  Google wheat + gluten.lol yup ..nice postBleached flour contains mycotoxins (sp) which is fungus that resemble cancer cells happens to looks just like.
