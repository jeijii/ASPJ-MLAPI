    Over the past few years, a renewed interest in natural parenting has spread like wildfire. Books, magazines, and websites have all been outlets for increasing awareness of natural childbirth, nutrition, and holistic parenting techniques. With all of this ongoing discussion, some interesting ideas are bound to spring forth once in a while. Perhaps one of the most unusual is making homemade yogurt from breast milk. It may sound bizarre at first, but really isn’t such an odd idea after all.            Yogurt, while common, isn’t usually on the radar when constructing a meal plan for a baby. Regardless, breast milk yogurt, may be a healthy option for your baby. Yogurt itself provides a host of  (termed “probiotics”) that aid in balancing the digestive system, regulating mood, and supporting the immune system.    Breast milk is also a great source of nutrients, protein, CLA, and lauric acid, a fatty acid responsible for fighting off infections, harmful organisms and supporting cardiovascular health.      Other fatty acids, like omega-3 fatty acids, are also found in breast milk, and promote proper brain development. The combination of lauric acid and probiotics in breast milk yogurt may skyrocket its nutritional value.   Research shows that a baby’s nutritional status often sets the pace for their life. Not only are dietary habits typically set during the baby’s first few years, metabolic state is also arranged during this time and it’s based on what the baby consumes.    Making baby food at home requires extreme care, knowledge, and healthy safety implementations in order to produce a clean, safe product for your infant. Breast milk yogurt should be produced in a sanitary environment and only if the mother (or other caretaker) knows what they are doing.
