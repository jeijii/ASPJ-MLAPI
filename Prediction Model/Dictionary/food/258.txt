      , the ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup, is the most heavily used herbicide on GMO crops. In 2007 (the most recent year for which data is available), U.S. farmers used 88,000 tons of glyphosate. Not accounting for increased use, that adds up to 580,000 tons of glyphosate dumped onto our food and into our soil and water in the past six years alone.            That is completely unacceptable.    The safety of  is highly suspect and adding toxic poison like glyphosate only compounds the problem. Research shows that glyphosate is causing chronic, long-term health problems for all of us, especially our kids. In the words of one scientist, the negative impact of glyphosate residues found in the Western diet “ . . . is insidious and manifests slowly over time, as swelling and redness damages cellular systems throughout the body.”    The problem is getting worse.    Earlier this year, the FDA increased the limits for how much glyphosate is allowed to remain on your fruits and vegetables. Last week, the USDA approved a new glyphosate-resistant canola, the first of several new glyphosate-resistant crops to be deregulated under a new joke-of-a-review process.    Currently, GMO foods do not need to be labeled. This makes it very difficult for consumers to avoid them. When laws mandate that this trash be labeled as such, consumers will be empowered to make better, more informed choices. Monsanto and the agri-chemical industry do not want you to be empowered, they want you to be a mindless drone that gives them your money while quietly consuming their toxic poison.    It’s time for a change and the Organic Consumer’s Association is leading the charge. Currently, Washington State is the battle ground in the fight against Monsanto. There is an initiative, I-522, to mandate GMO labeling of food in Washington State.    You can help the Organic Consumer’s Association win I-522, Washington State’s GMO labeling initiative by donating today. Your donation will help the Organic Consumer’s Association continue the battle for GMO labeling laws and expose GMO crops for what they are: an excuse for Monsanto to profit off of poison.    The time to donate is nearing its end but the Organic Consumer’s Association is about $20k short of their goal — and the goal is not arbitrary, if they  raise $150,000 by July 27, Dr. Joseph Mercola will make a matching donation of $150,000!    When consumers stop buying foods containing genetically modified ingredients, food manufacturers will stop putting GMOs in their products. We can only stop Monsanto if we continue the fight and don’t give up. Global Healing Center has donated, join us in the cause and !
