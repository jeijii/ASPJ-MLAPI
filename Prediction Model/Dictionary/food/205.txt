        Hemp is a plant so versatile in its uses, itâ€™s hard to believe there are some fools among us who . Itâ€™s a shame, because around the globe, hemp has been used for centuries to make rope, wax, paper, cloth, fuel and as a food source. Nutritionally, the seeds of the plant are one of the most complete sources of vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and potent antioxidant activity.            Hemp seed offers a high quality protein source with an amino acid profile that exceeds many meat and dairy-based protein sources; this can be extremely attractive to .  A recent Chinese study examined hemp seed to evaluate its physiochemical and chemical composition.  The results revealed a protein content higher than most grains and  and concentrations of unsaturated fats in excess of 90%, much more than most vegetable oils.  The polyunsaturated fatty acids were primarily comprised of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids.  High concentrations of  were also observed.      The results of this study set the bar for hemp seed and indicated it is truly one of the most nutritious foods available. Letâ€™s start by taking a look at how linoleic and alpha-linolenic fatty acids have been identified as essential to healthâ€¦    Alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) as found in hemp seed has been associated withâ€¦    Studies have also demonstrated that people with low levels of ALA may suffer from metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome can be a problem as it increases the risk for type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease.     Studies have shown linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) occurs naturally, in hefty amount, in hemp seed.  Appropriate proportions of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids must be maintained for health â€” and hemp seed offers an almost perfect balance.  Linoleic acid contributes to radiant skin, liver and kidney function, hair growth, proper immune function and cardiovascular health.      Researchers have determined hemp seed contains high phenolic content and powerful antioxidant properties.  In one test, hemp seed antioxidants outperformed , soybean, and grapeseed extracts in total antioxidant activity.  It also provided greater protection against LDL oxidation, a common factor in cardiovascular problems.  Additional antioxidant activity was observed in its amino acid profile.    Hemp seed also contains vitamin E, an essential vitamin for cardiovascular and brain health.  Without vitamin E, brain function suffers and voluntary muscle control can be lost â€” big problem.  Vitamin E provides important antioxidant effects for polyunsaturated fatty acids (the omega-3s and -6s) as it protects them from oxidation and supports cardiovascular health.     Another added bonus with hemp seed is that hemp seed provides an ideal medium for vitamin E absorption because vitamin E is fat-soluble, ensuring greater vitamin E .

So lets grow it like we did in Wisconsin in years past and cause a headache for growers of illegals and anyone who would like to smoke it.Thatâ€™s an interesting idea. Is there a news story link or something of this happening in Wisconsin?Iâ€™ve seen that the hemp would have to be grown in with the marijuana crops to have any kind of effect. This would have no effect on indoor grows. Besides its more of a myth of the ultra get high dope. There is nothing wrong with getting high and its also an needed medicine for the sick.Many of the sites sited here do not come up when clicked on.  A .gov blank comes up instead.

We originally started taking it for pain. Both of us have chronic pain but donâ€™t want to take narcotics. We were amazed! Then I read the bottle and it talked about the omega6and 3 benefits. The first time we got online it was really expensive for a small amount. Recently a friend told us where to get some in the organic section in the grocery store. Alot cheaper and itâ€™s the same stuff. We take it everyday. So grateful we found this itâ€™s a life saver.
