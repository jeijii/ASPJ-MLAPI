          It’s just as concerning as it sounds. Scientists have introduced into plants and animals, new, scientifically manipulated or chosen, genetic material, to advance and suppress traits as they see fit. The products are .    From as early as the 70’s, scientists have been genetically manipulating crops. Scientists used these soil bugs along with other gene-implantation technologies to develop numerous new types of crops.          These crops are steadily increasing in our and other countries as well. Some countries are not so completely receptive. The genetic materials are selected to promote resistance to pesticides, herbicides and insecticides; higher nutrient levels; larger produce; and tolerance to extreme weather conditions.    Many of the genetically modified foods you can find on your grocers’ shelves, today, because they  in the United States. These include: cottonseed oil, soybeans, cocoa beans, canola and corn. Scientists have even created plants that produce plastics and pharmaceutical compounds, not for human consumption. Feed grade corn is approved only for livestock food.    This all sounds really good, right? You’ve got your larger produce, which goes further; resistance to pesticides, herbicides and insecticides; enhanced flavor and consistent crop growth. But, you can’t stop there; you have to track the whole story.    FDA-employed scientists presented warnings that a certain species of tomato could generate toxins in foods and trigger allergies. And still it was approved. These foods are presenting more toxins that must pass through your colon, some of which can become trapped creating a .    On farms that large companies own, they genetically modify their crops. They don’t rotate crops, which is a process that gives the earth time to replenish itself. Instead, they simply soak into the ground chemical fertilizers that force the land to yield vegetation, the same vegetation. They kill many of the bugs that naturally would live and die in the soil replacing nutrients.    These foods introduce toxins that reportedly caused lesions in the lab rats. If that is the measure for safety in humans, this is not a good start. The lesions in the rats could spell danger from ulcers for humans.    The test performed by the Food and Drug Administration was haphazard at best. And even that was not enough to stop the government from pronouncing the test a success, and extending the approval response to other GM foods, therein negating the necessity for testing future produce.    Organically grown foods are grown on land that is free of harsh pesticides. These foods are grown in naturally cultivated, rotated soil. The produce has far fewer of the chemicals in it, and sometimes more nutrients as well. There are numerous reasons I recommend , but the decision is ultimately yours. What will you choose?

Thanks for sharing it.Montauk is said to be engineering animal/human hybrids. There are a few (allegedly) trying their best & winning to destroy the world by genetically modifiing everything known to mankind.
I have many friends who have spoken about your blog so I thought I’d have a look & WOW!, I am impressed! Keep it up….thankyou Dr! ..doin a research about GMO…and your article was informative enough…It seems that all kinds of scientists have free reign to experiment, test and develop anything they please. They do not have to prove it is harmless, that it will not cause future problems, or that it won’t destroy everyone on planet earth at some point. No, they can do exactly as they please, and the public has absolutely nothing to say about it.  It doesn’t matter if it takes over the food supply, the water supply or the air we breathe. It doesn’t matter if it pollutes, kills the animals and people, produces deformities in nature and organisms. Citizens on earth are nothing more than a huge laboratory, put here, it seems, for the pleasure, excitement and profit of science, industry and government. we have little voice, and spend much of our time trying to avoid what science has created in order to stay alive and out of the hospital. Most of us cannot afford “organic” foods. They are terribly overpriced, and there is no reason for it. It’s just food that uses alternative methods for pest control, and does not use toxins to grow the plants. Or so they say. Wherein is the expense?? Bottom line is that most people will have no choice but to eat Frankenfoods and suffer the consequences, since our governments could give a you-know-what.I am so scared to eat anything…..The government is more concerned about money that providing people with nutritious foods.Maybe it is actually the organic companies charging higher prices to in order to boost their profit?Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()Pingback: ()
