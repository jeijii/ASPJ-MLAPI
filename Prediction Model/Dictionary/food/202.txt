    Cultures and countries across the world use and appreciate the coconut tree. Because of its nutritional and therapeutic values, it‚Äôs referred to as ‚ÄúKalpavriksha‚Äù (the all giving tree) in India. As the name implies, the coconut palm is extremely versatile and used in many capacities. Everything from the , to the leaves, to the kernel hull have characteristics that are beneficial to human health.  Coconut oil, specifically, has become quite popular for cooking and even other uses. Let‚Äôs take a look at a few facts about coconut oil that you may not know.I‚Äôve heard reports from people who are confused when they spot coconut oil at the grocery store, read the nutritional label, and see the high saturated fat content. ‚ÄúWhat gives?‚Äù they ask, ‚ÄúI thought this stuff was healthy?‚Äù Well, it is.Unfortunately, the fat in coconut has been the subject of debate and misinformation. Although we‚Äôre told that saturated fat, across the board, is bad, the saturated fats in coconut oil are medium chain fatty acids ‚Äî these are different than saturated fat from animal sources ‚Äî and do not degrade within the body. In fact, the human body uses them directly as energy and coconut oil consumption has even been associated with beneficial lipid profiles.   is even better than other vegetable oils like sunflower or safflower oil. Those oils contain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which aren‚Äôt good for the cardiovascular system. Many nutritional experts recommend switching to coconut oil to avoid the health risks. Coconut oil is used in a staggering amount of , conditioners, and hair care products.  The reason for its inclusion is quite simple. With its low molecular weight and straight linear chain, coconut oil can effectively penetrate the hair shaft to reduce protein loss, leaving it nourished and healthy. Coconut oil is also very moisturizing and beneficial for the skin.  In many cultures, it‚Äôs used as a remedy for a great many skin conditions.  The reason? It‚Äôs chemical structure. The short-chain and saturated fatty acids, which prevent it from oxidizing and becoming rancid, are nourishing to the skin and have even been found to encourage wound healing. Perhaps one of the most astounding facts about coconut oil is how potent it is against .Everyone loves ice cream but not everyone is keen on the milk fat used to produce it. What‚Äôs the alternative? Bland, fat-free ice cream? Maybe not. It seems that virgin coconut oil may be an acceptable replacement for milk fat in ice cream. Those who have tried it claim that the ice cream has a pleasant coconut flavor and an excellent appearance, texture, and aroma.  (If you‚Äôve happened to try it, please leave a comment below and let us know the brand and what you thought.)Did you know that giving oil massages to newborns has been found to improve thermoregulation and encourage healthy weight gain? A 2005 study evaluated the effect of coconut oil on the growth of newborns in India. Starting on the second day of their lives, an oil massage was given four times a day by a trained person until the baby was discharged, and then by the mother until the baby was 31 days old. The results? Coconut oil massage significantly increased weight gain and growth. It might be premature to call coconut oil an antidote for poisoning but a 2005 incident in Iran certainly suggests it may have something to offer. Hospital officials there reported of a young man who had attempted suicide by ingesting the pesticide aluminium phosphide. Upon admittance to the hospital, he was experiencing severe indications of toxicity and given several counteractive substances, including charcoal, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium sulphate, and coconut oil. The result? He survived, and coconut oil, while probably not deserving of all the credit, was labeled as an important part of the protocol. Do you know a coconut oil factoid that we missed? Or do you just have great things to say about coconut oil‚Ä¶ or even constructive criticism? Please leave a comment below and join the discussion!

I began massaging raw organic coconut oil into his tail, body and paws and to some extent, his furry little LasaApso head.  The flees emerged rapidly and were quickly dispatched.

The cholesterol will go up but the HDL will do what it needs to balance it. Most test cholesterol goes up (no vco) but look at the HDL. Look it up to find a good explanation, I am stumbling here, sorry. Any way bottom line they say it is not a bad thing.Perhaps you could look it up and put it in your reading.
