Fats are a highly varied , and they’re present in both animal and plant-derived foods. At nine calories per gram, fat is the most dense source of calories required by the human body. However, not all fats are created equally and it’s crucial to pay attention to which types of fat you include in your diet. , some are fairly neutral, while others are actively detrimental to your health.        The War on Fat began in the late 1980s and ushered in an era of high-sugar, high-carb, low-fat, and fat-free snack foods. You might remember the resurgence of the Atkins Diet and  the introduction of Mediterranean Diet books from the late 1990s that finally made dietary fat socially-acceptable and medically-recommended again. The truth is that a diet that includes the right kind of fat is not just beneficial, but downright critical to your health.  Fats perform a number of duties in your body, such as helping absorb certain  and keeping your skin and hair healthy. The process of creating, storing, and using fat is how energy is kept in balance. Fats enable your body to absorb and hoard fat-soluble vitamins in the liver and fat tissue. Vitamins A, D, K, and beta-carotene typically have an absorption rate of about 80%, while  is absorbed at a rate of about 20%. In one study,  absorption increased simply by adding fat to the meal. When the fat content of the meal was 30% of the calorie count, the vitamin D3 absorption improved significantly. Fat is responsible for setting off basic metabolic processes that regulate growth, immune function, and reproductive development. If you’re trying to limit fat intake, obtain no less than 6% of your calories from fat to keep these systems functioning properly. At the other end of the spectrum, cap your fat intake at 20-35% of your total daily calories. Since fat contains more than twice the calories of protein or carbohydrates, excessive consumption can lead to weight gain.    Most dietary fats are “triglycerides.” These are composed of three fatty acid hydrocarbon chains bonded to a glycerol backbone. During the digestive process, bile breaks down triglycerides in the small intestine so they can be absorbed into the bloodstream via the liver and either directed into cells for immediate use or sent to lipocytes (fat cells) to be stored and used later.        When your body taps into its energy reserves, the first reserves used are carbohydrates, which are stored as branched chains of glycogen in the muscles and liver. Humans only store enough carbs to fuel about 20-30 minutes of vigorous activity. After that, your body switches its energy resource to fat reserves.  are the enzymes that break down fat stores to release energy for mitochondria. The metabolism of fat is aerobic (it ) and occurs in the mitochondria. The metabolism of carbohydrates is anaerobic (it does not require oxygen) to release energy.In addition to providing a calorie-dense source of energy, visceral fat protects organs in the abdominal cavity from damage. Subcutaneous fat insulates the muscles and helps regulate body temperature.  Dietary fat can be essential or non-essential. Essential fatty acids, like omega-6 (linoleic acid) and omega-3 (alpha-linoleic), cannot be produced by the human body—they need to be consumed. There are several subclassifications of these fats, like ALA and DHA, which are distinguished by their chemical structure. The body relies on essential fatty acids for blood clotting, neural development, and managing inflammation.   Non-essential fatty acids are still important to the body but can be produced internally with the proper resources. Saturated fat is not essential in a nutritional sense but is important for hormone regulation in the body.Whether a fat is saturated or unsaturated depends on the number of the hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon chain that makes up the triglyceride. If a fatty acid is saturated, there are no double bonds between the carbon atoms. The fatty acid chain is fully saturated with hydrogen atoms. If there are double bonds between two carbons in the chain, the fatty acid is either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated depending on the number of double bonds in the chain. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature because the hydrocarbon chains are closer together. These straight chains can stack together at the molecular level to become more viscous. Mono- and polyunsaturated fats are twisted or kinked at their double carbon bonds, preventing the chains from packing closely together.All naturally occurring classifications of fats are composed of a mixture of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, and saturated fatty acids. The physical state of any fat at room temperature is determined by which type of fatty acid is the most prevalent. In , the dominant fatty acid is monounsaturated, so it is liquid at room temperature. Butter is primarily made up of saturated fatty acids, so it is solid at room temperature.Trans fats are the notorious fats that have been skewered in the media for the last decade, much to the ire of processed food manufacturers. In July 2015, US officials announced they would  on these dangerous fats that promote cardiovascular disease by raising LDL (bad) cholesterol and lowering HDL (good) cholesterol. Trans fats are a product of hydrogenating the double-bonded carbon linkages in fatty acids so they become fully saturated with hydrogen atoms, turning once healthy fats into saturated fats. Hydrogenation increases the shelf life, palatability, and texture of processed food but contributes to cardiovascular disease. Trans fats are also found in tiny amounts in meat and dairy, but the amount is negligible.Trans fats are being phased out the American food supply but, in the meantime, avoid food that contains trans fats, such as:      Trans fats are structurally different from ordinary saturated fat. They cause disease and should be avoided entirely.    Saturated fats are primarily found in animal products like meat and dairy, but there a few plant-based sources such as palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and cocoa butter (chocolate fat). These fats are solid at room temperature. Although coconut oil and cocoa butter have redeeming qualities, saturated fat from animal products should be avoided as it can raise blood cholesterol and increase the risk heart disease and stroke. If you’re trying to prevent or slow the development of cardiovascular disease, it’s imperative to keep your total daily saturated fat calories to no more than 6%.    in that most of its saturated fat comes from stearic acid, which is a fatty acid that actually reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. If you do choose to include it in your diet, make sure the only fat in the ingredients is cocoa butter or stearic acid. Lower-quality chocolate usually includes milk fat or other saturated fats.Unsaturated fats are often described as healthy fats because they have the opposite effect of saturated fats. Unsaturated fats lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol. Consumption of these fats can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Unsaturated fats are concentrated in the oils naturally found in fish, nuts, seeds, and some fatty fruits. They can be monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.  Monounsaturated fatty acids are often promoted as “heart healthy” because they lower LDL cholesterol, reducing your risk of heart attack and stroke. The greatest concentrations are found in olive, sunflower, and safflower oil, as well as avocados and most nuts. The oils found in these sources also provide vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin.  Polyunsaturated fatty acids, also referred to as PUFAs, are the predominant fats in fish (such as salmon), vegetable oils, and some nuts and seeds. Omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated and cannot be synthesized by the body.The general agreement is that most people should consume more  to reduce the risk of developing the diet-related chronic diseases that plague Western societies.  Omega-3 fatty acids can help slow the development of arterial plaque, reduce triglycerides, and reduce the risk of arrhythmia.  Too much cholesterol in the blood is called high blood cholesterol. Doctors typically order a lipoprotein panel, also called a lipid profile, to determine your standing. The test measures three forms of fat in the blood:  Experts recommend a total cholesterol level below 200 mg/dL. The following chart describes the different categories cholesterol levels fall within.  To keep your cholesterol levels in check, I strongly recommend a . Vegetarians typically have significantly lower cholesterol levels than omnivores, and vegans usually have the lowest. If a raw food diet is not realistic for you, do your best to avoid processed foods and eat a lot of leafy greens, , and vegetable oils such as flaxseed. Look out for partially hydrogenated oils on your nutrition labels; even if a package says “0 grams of trans fat” it can still have up to 0.5 g of trans fats in every serving. Try to reduce or eliminate your consumption of saturated fat and cook with extra virgin olive oil. One of the most delicious ways to  of excess cholesterol is to eat more fiber. Research indicates bile acids, which are synthesized from cholesterol, bind to soluble fiber in the intestines. This bound bile is later eliminated from the colon, and more cholesterol must be pulled from the blood to synthesize more bile. Eat foods high in soluble fiber such as oats, whole grains, beans, and citrus fruits to lower your cholesterol.Fats are an essential part of a healthy diet, but be mindful of what you’re consuming.

After that,   your body switches its energy resource to fat reserves”.  Waahoo Doc, that means I’m on the treadmill for 40 or more minutes just to get rid of 20 minutes worth of that stubborn fat, or, maybe not eat as much P food in the first place.
Can’t get it into your diet….  a 2 once shot of liquid fat (Olive, Avocado, Coconut) in the AM: and get on with the day…  Better than Meds.
Mix your own dressing,, try liquid oil with Turmeric and Black pepper.

Here are some things I’ve believed to be true:1) Eat as much saturated and monounsaturated fats as you want (this includes a high-fat diet, where these fats make up a larger percent of the diet)2) Saturated fats are best for you, as they have no room for oxidization. They also are most like our own vital fat in our own bodies, making them the healthiest for us. Monounsaturated are “second best” and polyunsaturated, vulnerable as they are to oxidization, should be kept to a minimum. However I am aware that the essential fatty acids are polyunsaturated fats. As I said, I am a bit unclear3) Coconut oil is a wonder food. I actually sometimes will eat a spoonful for it’s beneficial properties like caprylic acid4) Vegetable oils are badWhat I gleaned from this article is that saturated fats should be kept to a minimum. I wondered if that was the case for all sat. fats or only animal fats that poorly affected cholesterol. Also, is that just for people with cardiovascular disease, or should everyone largely keep sat. fat (even coconut oil) intake low? And should we or should we not be concerned with unstable fats? Any insight would be helpful. Thanks!Hi, Janeta. Our bodies are mainly composed of saturated and monounsaturated fats, so it’s ideal to include more of them in your diet (in moderation) than polyunsaturated fats. They are also more easily used in your body. Although polyunsaturated fats are considered essential since our bodies do not naturally produce them, it’s important to have PUFAs in small amounts due to their high oxidative properties. Overall, we find that reducing your saturated fat intake or eating plant-based saturated fats is ideal in lowering cholesterol whether you’re healthy or have a pre-existing condition.Vegetable oils are PUFAs, so while you may include vegetable oils (like flaxseed oil) in a vegan-based diet, consider them still in moderation and concentrate on the big picture whether your vegan or not. It’s important to eliminate processed foods and incorporate more leafy greens and soluble fiber in your diet to properly utilize and process the healthy fats you eat. As for unrefined oil, it’s best used for salad dressings or low temperature cooking, and refined oil with it’s higher smoking point helps prevent rancidity in all of your cooked meals. However, refined oil will be lacking in minerals and enzymes which we imagine can be obtained from the other foods in your diet. To avoid this loss of nutrients, you can also try following a raw food vegan-based diet where only unrefined oils are needed to make your meals.
